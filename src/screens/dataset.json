It was nice because we went during an off time and were able to sit inside to eat without a huge crowd. The beer was the usual big woods beer- I live and die by their cinnamon blonde. It tastes like a snickerdoodle beer and is incredible. My mom, a lifelong miller lite drinker loves their six foot blonde. And we had a sample of some of their spirits and they were incredible too. I spent way too much already or I would have gotten some of those to go. \n\nTheir food is a smaller selection than the speedway or Nashville location but they still have some good stuff. I forgot to take photos but I got the grilled chicken sandwich (yum), my mom got the nachos and my dad got the wings. They both loved their meals too. Absolutely will be back. Especially if we ever get out of this pandemic.",

All in all the meal was good, but I felt the food was kind of pricey. We enjoyed: \n\nSide Greek salad (excellent taste and value)\nIndividual Margherita pizza (large portion for an individual but it was filling with the thicker style crust)\nCandied bacon bomb burger with Parmesan truffle fries. It was very good but huge. Glad I shared this with my husband. Not sure it's a $15 burger, but it was tasty. \nSignature pulled pork sandwich - generous serving of pork. My son took half home. \n\nTips: \n1-Upgrade to Parmesan truffle fries. They are fabulous and you will so glad you did. \n2-Sample some beers to get exactly what I want. We ended up loving the Java red.\n3-Servings are large. Consider sharing. \n4-The manager greeted every table and I like that extra touch of service.",

Both times, some part of our order was incorrect. They fixed things happily, but the rest of the order is sitting there getting cold while you're waiting for them to remake whatever was wrong. \n\nWasn't impressed w the burger. Ordered med rare and it was well done. Bun was hard. But pizza is pretty good. Our favorite is the Homestead. And the cheesy bread is delicious, but not enough of it to justify the price. They must make their own Ranch cause it's interesting in a good way.",

The location is convenient to the campus and sparkling clean. We sat in the bar area. The bartender was responsible for tables, making drinks and carry out. She seemed to be overwhelmed a bit but did fine taking our order and delivering our food and drinks in a timely manner. I had a Greek salad with chicken. The lettuce was crispy and chicken was hot and juicy. Tomato slices were thick cut but soft and tasted close to the end of their time. The portion of black olives was insane unless olives are your favorite part of a salad. Dressing was good, served on the side and there was plenty. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries. Don't expect them to be super crispy but expect tons of flavor. They are really good! I think I'll try a sandwich next visit.",

We all went for burgers and two did brews. Enjoyed it all, no one had complaints, we miss Stacked Pickle for its amazing appetizers and creative burgers at a great value but this will do OK despite fierce competition. I personally take to Teay's River with it's massive menu and fresh drips. The Tap drowns everyone with an overwhelming beer list. Big Woods mixes those two together to boast on the campus vibes, easy parking, and Nashville inspired fare.",

      "text": "Was really excited to try this place as it looked like a nicer dinner place that campus needed. Unfortunately it fell short in most categories. For starters the service was very sub par. Drinks/beers were asked about and the explanation was less than what was actually written about them. The food tastes pretty good, but for ~12-15$ a plate I was thinking there would something memorable or even my medium rare burger being at least slightly pink. The beer and drinks were also quite good, but again 12-15$ for a specialty cocktail and 7$ for a pint should give you something that is high quality and unique. The ambiance also doesn't reflect what they're going for as it looks just like Stacked Pickle did (sports bar) but it's a brewery/distillery/cocktail bar. I would say you can do much better at LBC, Teays, The Bryant, or The tap for less money.",

The Reuben is so good, they really stack the sauerkraut on there, and there is plenty of meat as well. The ciabatta roll was perfection, a little crunchy but soft and chewy on the inside. I will definitely be stopping by again, just wish it wasn't on the other side of town because it's the perfect quick lunch spot.",

I live in Seattle and was planning on visiting to celebrate birthdays with my parents who are turningg 92 and 94. COVID-19 changed my plans. I ordered  from Homestead via Grubhub since I couldn't travel to take my parents to dinner. Unfortunately Grubhub never showed up. When I called Homestead to explain the situation the manager of the West Lafayette store, Michelle stepped in. It was a Grubhub failure, in no way Homestead's fault.  That wasn't good enough for Michelle. After her long day at work Michelle called me to say she was going to personally deliver a meal to my parents, on her own time, in her personal vehicle. We are all facing a terrible situation with COVID, but this is a business managed by an individual with heart,  who cares about her customers on a personal.level. Also at her own expense, Michelle even brought flowers and a card when she delivered the meal (I didn't ask for that she just took it upon herself to do it). If I still lived in West Lafayette my family would be eating at Homestead every week. You will love the food, but even more importantly this is a business with heart. Thank you Michelle!!!",

I almost don't want to recommend the frosted cutout cookies for fear I will come to buy them and they will be sold out.

I got the patemsan crusted Cod special with coconut corn & pineapple salsa and it was stellar! It was so good I forgot to take a picture at first. My hubby got the rib basket and it was just great comfort food like always! \nI had a horrible migraine and they allowed me to come in without a mask. My hubby wore one as required but I appreciate their willingness to allow me that mask exemption. \nThey have a great side parking lot for parking.",

      "text": "Disappointing overall.\n  So many good reviews but not what we experienced.\nIn fact, this was the most disappointing meal we've had in Lafayette.\nThe ribs were DRY - how do you dry out fatty pork ribs?  The taste was ok but they were almost inedible.\nThe Shrimp & Grits were terrible.  The grits were solid at room temperature, they use cheap shrimp which were over cooked, rubbery, and poorly seasoned.  The brown sauce/gravy on this dish was the only thing that saved it.\nThe Pork Belly egg rolls were very good, the drinks were also good, but the delivery was VERY slow.. \n We could hear and see the martinis being shaken and then watched them sit  on the bar for several minutes.\n Same suspected for the food, based on the condition at the table, it had probably been sitting a while.\n  We were so disappointed that we didn't order dessert and we didn't take our leftover food to the dogs. Such a shame.\n I hate to see a small town restaurant get a bad review, but considering it was our worst meal yet, it's within walking distance of our house and we won't probably be going back, they need to address these issues.",

      "text": "We enjoyed our dinner tremendously . Fabulous food. Our server was a little Pompous which rubbed us just a little the wrong way telling us each entree how exactly the chef would make it with no exceptions. Example - said certain steak entree the chef would only prepare it medium rare or medium. I asked \"what if I wanted it medium well?\" And the answer was NO. I get it but there were several entrees like this presented to us how we could or could not have it. Ever heard of customer is always right? Outside of this slight pickiness the vibe was good and we loved the food just turn down the pompous deal a tad and it will be 100%. Will return and please known we did like our experience",

      "text": "On our way back from Chicago to Indy we were craving a continuation of the fabulous food of the city and decided to veer into Lafayette for a peek at the options. We ended up at East End Grill and immediate lived the interior, the friendly welcome and the menu options. The warm wood finishing a amid the steel helped with noise reduction and the variety of tables gave us an option near the window to enjoy the sunshine.\n\nOur server was fabulous and explained several of the options even going so far as to consult with the kitchen as to how to turn some of the dishes vegan. Her sunny disposition and ease of service was a nice balm after the drive.\n\nThe mead spritzer I tried (we abandoned the vegan for vegetarian to try the mead) was delightful and refreshing. I loved the crispness and tart aftertaste.\n\nHowever the delight was the Brussels sprouts appetizer with a hint of smoky flavor, perfect char on the veggies and a liberal portion of perfectly flavored hummus. This starter was a signal of the flavors to come, as my beet and arugula salad with orange, pepitas and balsamic was so fresh with sweetness and acid mixing perfectly. Then came the amazing, oh so perfect gnocchi. It was a butternut squash base which literally melted in your mouth with such depth of flavor I couldn't stop eating! The additions of capers, spinach and crispy crunch on the toppings just made the dish delightful. I have only had gnocchi this good one other time, and this lives in my tastebuds and dreams. Yum!!\n\nWe are already talking about when we will come back as this flavor is worth the drive! Plus an added bonus was a visit from the manager to say hi and check in on us. So amazing! If you haven't been then head on over as East End Grill is not to be missed!",

Josh was our attentive server who enthusiastically informed us that the restaurant makes everything from scratch with fresh ingredients. We decided to have a rather light lunch that we shared consisting of a delicious crab cake, side salad, and the house cut truffle fries with a garlic sauce that stole the show. Crisp, lightly flavored with truffle oil, and dusted with Parmesan cheese....these fries were the best I've had in many years and I consider myself a fry connoisseur. If you find yourself in downtown West Lafayette, make a point of stopping by this restaurant for the fries and friendly service.",

Very well done. I was extremely impressed and the whole time we were eating, we were taking about the decor. So well done and I am applauding you!\n\nOkay, so now on to the main point. FOOD. \n\n1/5 stars. The best thing we ate, was the truffle fries. And honestly if we got those to go and didn't eat anything else or if we weren't served, this would be a higher rated review. \nThose fries though...I would come back just for those. Hat is off to them for those god sends. \n\nWe also ordered a salmon burger and a cheese burger. Both were terrible and we didn't even eat them. \n\nService. -5/5 stars. Our server changed several times. I don't even know if we had a server. Maybe we came during a shift change, but nevertheless at the most, we should have had at max 2 servers. We had at least half a dozen. Step that up.\n\nAll in all, order a to go order of Truffle Fries, go inside to look at the beautifulness and leave.",

I haven't had the chance to visit the restaurant yet given the current COVID-19 situation, but we had food delivered via GrubHub. \n\nI'm a pescatarian so these are the dishes I tried:\n- spicy pancakes: this is a staple Korean dish for (I get it pretty much every time I go out for Korean food). 5/5\n- spicy squid: 5/5\n- spicy seafood udon noodles: 3/5\n\nWe also got 2 small complimentary dishes: boiled broccoli with some pickled vegetables and a type of miso soup. Both were fantastic!\n\nAlthough all the dishes we ordered were labelled as spicy, it's not an overbearing kind of heat. I felt it was just the right amount (for me personally). Portions are reasonable for the prices. They have a good variety of seafood, vegetarian and non-veg items on the menu. \n\nWill definitely be ordering from them again. Keep up the great work. \n\nOn a side note: the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because all the items were delivered in non-recyclable containers/plastic ware/ styrofoam packaging.",

      "text": "Came to visit my sister and her friends at Purdue and they picked this Korean restaurant to eat at! Kimchi is located right off the road, next to a gas station with the restaurant name in big letters.\n\nWalking in around 2pm, there weren't many people so the atmosphere was quiet and nice. The interior was spacious and would be great for big parties (we comfortably sat 8 of our friends with us).\n\nI had ordered the Korean cold noodles and the bowl was HUGE!! I had eaten a lot of KBBQ at a different restaurant the day before so I wanted something light to counterbalance all the meat. It was the perfect choice in my opinion. \n\nThe broth was a good balance between refreshing and tangy and there were many noodles in my bowl - I was a happy camper. They also gave you two bottles of sauce and vinegar if you wanted to add a little bit more of each into your broth.\n\nThe waiter was very polite and very friendly - he made our experience great. Only downside about Kimchi is that it is a little pricy compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. Overall, good experience and would come here next time I'm at Purdue!",

      "text": "My wife and I were in West Lafayette visiting our daughter, SIL and granddaughter and tried this place, which was new to me and my wife, but which my daughter and her family had patronized before. We ordered delivery, which arrived promptly and accurately via DoorDash, and were, with one exception, very pleased with our meal.\n\nThe one exception was the seafood yaki udon (you can get some Japanese food here as well as Korean). My wife didn't think this meal lived up to its picture on the restaurant webpage. On the other hand, she was VERY satisfied with the seafood pancake, and will not hesitate to order it again.\n\nMy daughter and I had the bulgogi, and we were also satisfied with that, me very much so. The meat was flavorful and juicy, and the portion was large enough for me to get two substantial dinners from it. (The leftover portion microwaved very nicely.) \n\nWe also all shared an order of vegetarian dumplings, and even though I am not much one for vegetables, I found these quite tasty. \n\nI think the next time we eat from here (and there will certainly be a next time) I might like to try the Korean spicy pork, provided that it's not too spicy. It's the closest thing I could see on the menu that resembles Korean barbeque. It will be hard, however, to pass up the bulgogi.",

We all ordered the bibimbap and it was delicious in both volume and the amount of toppings (meat, eggs, veggies, etc). You can tell they make the dish in a traditional pot as it was even tastier to scrape the slightly charred (but not burnt) rice off the bottom and sites of the ginormous pot. The one star deduction is for the bulgogi flavor. I am use to the meat having more of a profile other than being soft/bland. Other than that, great food. Also tried the japchae, which could have been more for the price we paid but pretty tasty.",

The service was good. The atmosphere was very nice as well.",

The food is just not good enough to be worthy of it becoming a favorite. Ribeyes are normally tender, mine wasn't. The add-on \"mushrooms and onions\" was 95% onions. Our server was very busy and I watched my beer sit at the bar for about 10 minutes...and most aggravating, I watched the bartender use a swizzle stick to stir up a head on it after it had dissipated. That's just tacky.  Prices are reasonable - maybe raise your steak prices a little and buy better beef?  A little effort is all it takes to go from meh to good in this case.",

Steak was prepared a perfect medium, and the sea bass was flaky enough to not use a fork.  We split a delicious crepe brûlée for dessert.  It's not the least expensive restaurant in town, but we'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.",

Our server was Tony, nothing short of amazing! He was funny kept the drinks coming, just an all around awesome server! The Calamari was BOMB!!! It was seasoned so well and fried perfectly, I could've ordered three more. My steak was a bit on the rare side but again tony was so great I couldn't complain. The steak was also a bit chewy, I wasn't a fan. My friend loved her burger and fries, she stated the pretzel bun was so soft and it didn't taste like a pretzel (she doesn't like pretzels) and even though the burger was cooked well done she said it was still soooo juicy! My other friend didn't quite like the crab cake (more cake than crab) we're lump crab cake eaters and it wasn't lump. The meal wasn't perfect but the experience was really really nice. I really enjoyed my birthday Thank you Tony!!!",

      "text": "I am remiss in not writing a review here a LONG time ago... We have been coming here since the late 80's when students at Purdue and it was Stiney's with the boat out front... \n\nThere are many steak / seafood places in Central Indiana, but there are very few with the attention to food selection and preparation detail as McGraw's. From simply amazing cuts of beef like an amazing filet, ribeye and more (do not pass up the horseradish sauce that accompanies the ribeye). There is also a special cut off of a ribeye that is simply my go-to but is not on the menu. The catfish is just the same as Stiney's used to serve and a true calling card for this estabishment. The chef also brings in from time to time some of the best oysters from around the country and they DO NOT dissapoint (he was previously at a seafood place in LAF that had the best oysters in Central IN). Great appetizers as well with the Firecracker shrimp highly recommended. \n\nWe are here often and it is a bit like our Cheers of Greater Lafayette. We haven't made a reservation in years and prefer to find a seat at the bar or one of the few bar-side tables. It has a casual vibe and is not pretentious, yet guests in jeans or their dress finest are both seen here nightly. The bar service is one of the best around as well, and Mike the head bar-keep knows what we want as soon as he sees us and never misses the mark. It is normal to see the owner most every night and he clears tables and pitches in no matter if he is in jeans or a tie. It is clear he treats his staff well, and the longevity of them speaks volumes. \n\nYes we are very partial to McGraw's and yes we frequent it often. It is truly our type of place and there is no better place for us to spend an evening together for dinner or to just grab a drink and enjoy ourselves.",

In West Lafayette, IN, the top choices included Logan's roadhouse, Outback and Mountain Jacks. McGraws sounded right in my wheelhouse but some of the reviews made me nervous. I went anyway and was extremely pleased. It has a nice ambience, the service was just right and the food was excellent.",

      "text": "I've heard many of my friends talk about McGraw's as one of the nicer restaurants in the Lafayette area, so my boyfriend and I decided to go there for dinner on the night before Valentine's Day.\n\nIf you have not been here before, I recommend using a GPS so you don't miss the turn into the restaurant, especially if you have a late night dinner reservation.\n\nThe restaurant interior is very nice. It has a very home-y feel. The bar is situated in the front of the restaurant, and towards the back is a nice dining area where windows are so you can see the view of the Wabash River.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers, the smoked salmon on wonton skins, and the calamari. They both came out very quickly, much to our surprise. The smoked salmon was very good, although I think that it was a bit difficult to eat as the crispy wonton skins would break apart as soon as you took the first bite. My favorite appetizer, however, was the calamari. It is quite a large plate, enough for two or even three people to share, but it was so good we ate the whole plate! The sweet and spicy sauce that comes with the calamari is also an excellent complement with the dish.\n\nNot much longer after we finished devouring our appetizers, we got our entrees. I had ordered the ahi tuna dish, medium rare, that comes black pepper crusted atop a bed of spinach and slices of avocados. My boyfriend had ordered the ribeye steak, medium rare.\n\nThe tuna was cooked well, and tasted fresh to my surprise. My sides were linguini and steak cut fries. The linguini didn't have very much tomato sauce (which I enjoyed since I do not care for much sauce with my noodles), and the steak fries were crispy and not very oily like most fries tend to be.\n\nThe next time I go, however, I will order the ribeye. The few bites of the ribeye that I sampled were absolutely divine. The meat was a very good cut, tender, and had been seasoned and marinated well.\n\nYou would think that we were full after finishing al of our food, but in fact, we ordered two desserts! The chocolate lava cake and the raspberry cheesecake. We took them to go since the restaurant had closed, but even at home we were able to enjoy both desserts. Leave room for dessert, they are delicious!\n\nFor all the food we got (2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts), the total came to a little over $100, but for the quality of the food, service, and of course, the occasion, I was extremely satisfied.\n\nI definitely would recommend this place to anyone celebrating any occasion, graduations, anniversaries, birthdays, or even just to treat themselves!\n\nOh, and on the way out, there is a step. Do not be fooled. There is a small sign, but you will be so full and wanting to sit down in the car and digest that you won't even notice it. I almost fell, but if I did fall, I would have fallen a happy customer.",

The so called \"American Wagyu\" beef is probably raised in some random farm middle of the cornfields with no significant difference to the ones from Walmart.\nThe worst was yet to come. The spaghetti was so tangled up it was as thick as my index finger. The portions made me wonder if I have ordered from the kids menu... giving portions that match Michelin three star doesn't mean it make it so.\nOne star for the setup\none star for being an Purdue student\nOne star for fixing us with a new plate, which showed that they could do better\nThat's just about the limit of my generosity.",

Loved the ambience - not too noisy, mood lighting, decor is gorgeous! The bar and restaurant area are separate. There is also a place to to grab coffee/snacks if that's all you're in the mood for.\n\nWe tried the following from their dinner menu:\n1) Burrata Cheese with apricot mostarda, truffle honey, marcona almond, grilled rustic bread. The combination of the cheese + apricot is delicious!\n2) Shoestring fries\n3) Wild Mushroom Bolognese - I really enjoyed this dish. Not usually one to go for pasta, but this was definitely worth it. Very flavourful. \n4) Mille feuille - very tasty. The pastry was a little drier than what I'm used to, but I'd still recommend it. \n\nPortions are good. We shared the above between two people. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there aren't a lot (if at all any) vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, except for some salad and side items.",

      "text": "I post a 4 star review with several service related concerns. I'm sure those will be addressed before my next visit. We were seated and remained at an empty table for roughly 10 minutes. When the sever arrived she explained that she hadn't been told she was seated. The other servers and manager need to be aware of the entire dining room experience. After a lengthy apology with many excuses, we ordered drinks and asked for glasses for the water bottle she had brought to the table. Sometime later she returned to let us know the bar was backed up and our drinks would be out soon. We ordered an appetizer and again asked for water glasses. Sometime about 20 minutes after being seated, we received glasses for the water with another excuse that they were out of clean glassware. Of course the dozens of clean glasses sitting on the tables around us might have been a suitable alternative. No manager ever approached the table which meant they either weren't aware of the botched greeting process or didn't think it important to address the situation. Our drinks arrived and we settled into the experience. I had a simple martini. Presentation is 10/10. We shared the escargot. The dish was piping hot but the escargot was a bit chewy. Probably overcooked but the flavors were great. I had the seared salmon with lentils. The salmon was a perfect mid rare, lentils slightly mushy but good flavor. The server didn't suggest a starter. Another guest had the burger and said it was great. We requested dessert menus from the server. After checking out the options, we settled on the bread pudding. As we placed our order, she let us know that they were out of bread pudding. Hopefully a lesson learned: tell your guests you don't have certain items before leaving a menu on the table. We had the key lime pie which was great! I applaud the staff knowing that they are all in the hospitality program and learning as they are in the job. However, the prices don't reflect a learning environment rather a fine dining experience. Managers, if still in the learning process, need to do a better job of coaching and following up with the guests throughout. Looking forward to great food and improved service in the future.",

Our group of 5 was treated very well and took to all three menus. I noticed the prices for breakfast entrees and cocktails are downtown Chicago - not a $10.00 easy going fillup for either beverages or eggs! If this was a big city establishment, it would fit right in. With amazing morning egg spots offering more value like Town & Gown and Sacred Grounds, I'm sadly not sure I'll be here often despite the ideal menu options, designer interior, and delightful fare. They need a proper discount for local Purdue alumni! We all did a smattering of options from crepes, duck, and quinoa, couldn't complain about flavors or presentation. Can highly recommend the drinks and quinoa cakes were excellent. Thankfully the best value here is Leaps Coffee and their in house mixes. Ask what they're making! I'll have to save up and come back for a special day.",

They have a large drink menu with a good variety of craft beers and unique cocktails. \n\nThe dinner menu has a good balance of entrees and sandwiches. I had a hard time deciding what to order, but was hungry for fries so I went with a burger. I had the Strawberry Brie burger and my husband had the Chorizo burger. The flavor combination on each burger was fantastic. There was a generous amount of toppings, and my beef was cooked a perfect medium. The fries were cooked just right, and we received a large amount. Our server was friendly and professional, and all the staff made us feel welcome and comfortable.",

There was plenty to share between the two of us and we even had some to take home. \n\nNow the burgers were just okay. I favored the jalapeño burger over the Bryant, however both burgers were greasy. The jalapeño burger had too much sauce. I would recommend asking for the sauce on the side. \n\nI would come back, but I wouldn't order a burger.

They were more than happy to offer us curbside pick-up and kept the whole transaction contactless. \n\nFood:\n1) Their superfood salad comes with a red wine vinaigrette. The portion is great, but it was a very dry and stale salad. It was lacking in shaved parmigiano, pear, and dates. Definitely needs more dressing for the amount of shaved brussels and cabbage in there! I just would not recommend this dish for $8. \n2) The Impossible Burger is good, but it just seemed a bit \"flat\". Perhaps it could do with more lettuce, dijonnaise, cheese ? I'm not able to pinpoint the exact issue, but it's not a juicy burger, which is what I hoped for. \n3) The Impossible lasagna was my first taste of a vegan lasagna. This, I would recommend! It was flavorful, had the right balance of cheese and \"meat\", and it was a good portion size. The pesto sauce that comes with it was super yum!",

Our waiter, Josh, knew the menu inside and out. We got the pretzel appetizer. For my main dish I got the salmon with butternut squash purée, Just excellent.

I'm a former Lafayette restaurant for 28 years, and was visiting my family for thanksgiving when I stumbled on this newer spot, and I have to say I'm extremely upset it wasn't here when i lived in town.\n\nThe whole vibe of the place was great, and is a very trendy spot to grab dinner or drinks. I'm a burger fanatic so I went with the Bryant burger, and I'm \nglad I did.\n\nThe burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy, and the cheese melted perfectly over the patty. The bacon was thick the way bacon should be, with added onion straws for additional crunch. The fries were another big plus, which I've found in most restaurants like this, the burger is great with mediocre sides.\n\nFor $14, I have no complaints and plan on coming here each visit home!

The menu has something for just about anyone too with the variety of burgers, pasta, and steak/chicken options. I had The Bryant Burger, and my date had the ravioli. The burger is exceptional in flavor, and one of the best overall burgers I've ever had. The ravioli was also presented well and tasty. They have a great draft beer selection from local breweries too which is great. Overall price is about 50$ with tip and drinks for 2 which I think is very appropriate for the quality of the food and service.",

      "text": "I used to visit Morris Bryant for the seafood buffet when my parents would come to Purdue to visit.  Teenagers and food produce good memories.  On this occasion I brought my senior and college here - still good memories!\n\nThe facility is large and nice.  There is ample seating and the crowd moves along.  The noise level is very loud on a busy Saturday evening.   This can be difficult to enjoy conversation at times.  The place is nicely decorated and makes you feel welcome.  Note:  check out the integrated faucet and air dryers in the restrooms - very innovative!\n\nFor dinner we started with the pretzel and meatballs.  The pretzel was nice and moist with a good pull apart texture.  The mustard was very tasty as was the cheese.  The pretzel didn't feed many people though.  The meatballs were excellent- nice blend of cheeses and meats.  The marinara sauce with peppers was delicious!\n\nFor dinner I had the shrimp Cajun pasta.  The place specializes in burgers but that isn't my fare.  The pasta was cooked perfectly.  There were about 6 large shrimp which was plenty.  The sauce and peppers were creamy and very tasty.  I definitely recommend a side salad with the cucumber wasabi dressing. The lettuce was very cold as was the dressing- both accentuated each other very well.  The extra cold cut the rough wasabi edge so you could really enjoy the flavor.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and professional.  The hostess team seemed confused once the place out really busy.  We had to remind them our party of 4 had been waiting while other parties of 4 walked in and were seated ahead of us.\n\nOverall...an excellent experience!  Give it a try!!",

Kind of like a modern, industrial feel. But also homey in a way? It was amazing. We came on a Friday night so there was a bit of a wait for all 7 of us. No biggie because they had plenty of seating and standing room in the lobby. We also go cocktails while we waited. For apps we got the pretzel, meatballs,  and shrimp and everything was phenomenal. For an entree I got the mushroom risotto and it was incredible!

      "text": "We arrived for dinner on a Saturday evening. There were two other parties in our area when we arrived; one of those parties soon left. The interior is quite nice: lighting, carpeting, flooring, art, and the lay out of the space is quite cozy.  We were, at first, puzzled about why the place was so empty.  We ordered a cheese plate, which took a very long time to arrive, considering there weren't too many other people in the restaurant. The cheese was dry, and the fruit, which included some apple slices, tasted terrible. The apple, literally, tasted like someone had found it on the floor, sliced it up, and brought it out to us with the cheese.\n\nOur other dishes were flavorful, but skimpy and all of the \"hot\" dishes arrived lukewarm.  This place definitely is trying to experiment with flavors, textures, and ingredients, but they just can't get the execution right.  These dishes, also, took a long time to arrive, given that we were the only guests in the dining room who had ordered.\n\nThe worst, though, was the staff.  No one was rude or deliberately unresponsive.  However, several of the staff members were talking very, very loudly about things like drug use, and using a lot of profanity when they spoke. The acoustics of the restaurant were such that it was almost impossible for me to have a conversation with my dining partner, and we could not wait to leave. It was a huge turn-off.  All of the staff with whom we had contact seemed very inexperienced, and from what we could tell (e.g., their very loud conversations), they are college students who are in the job for a paycheck, not because they are interested in hospitality as a career.\n\nVery disappointing, and I'm not surprised that when we left, the dining area was +completely+ empty of guests. This, on a Saturday evening in the downtown area.",

The wine list is superb for Lafayette, IN with a range of options at different price points. \n\nOur appetizers were pork belly with sweetbreads, and steamed mussels with stilton and pernod. Both were infused with layers of complex flavors. \n\nFor entrees we ordered pork tenderloin with barley risotto in a calvados sauce and a steak with duck fat potatoes. The barley risotto was a perfect complement to the pork and all tasted great in the sauce. The steak was well prepared but was maybe less of a standout by comparison. \n\nDesserts took on more of a molecular gastronomy flair with a deconstructed berry cheesecake that was to die for. We also tried the chocolate panna cotta; the flavors were excellent but the consistency was a little tough. \n\nAll in all, Folie is a strong addition to the restaurant scene in Lafayette with upscale dining, delicious fresh food with innovative preparations, and a well curated wine list.",

      "text": "I visited Folie during the Christmas Parade. Not sure if it was because of the event, but the restaurant was more or less empty at 6:15 on Saturday. A few more parties came in during our meal, but it never came close to filling up.\n\nThe service was excellent. All the staff were kind, friendly, just great at their jobs. \n\nThe menu was small. I appreciate that. I despise large menus. I want to choose from what a restaurant is best at...I don't want to wade through nine pages. \n\nWe ordered a hot appetizer, a cold appetizer and two entrees. Respectively scallop, beet, lamb loin, monkfish/lobster\n\nPrior to any of this we received the bread with truffle oil butter. Not a huge truffle fan, but it was pretty good, so that's a win. The complimentary tasting soup they brought was excellent. Lentil-based, I believe. Very good. Best thing we ate actually.\n\nThe hot appetizer was a single seared scallop. Naturally I don't want overcooked scallops, but this was not cooked in the middle at all. And what I don't get is why this \"seared\" scallop had no coloration on the top or bottom. Not much of a sear-job when there's no color and the inside isn't cooked. The sauce with it was good. The portion was microscopic.\n\nNext was the \"Beets\". Not sure what i expected, but it was various types of beets. Not a beet fan, and these were beets. Need I say more? The beet sorbet was my favorite option. $13 for what amounted to a single beet. Who knew?\n\nMonkfish was just ok. Lobster with it was good. Sauce was decent. Combined it didn't add up to more than the sum of the parts. Was just three different things. Again, small portion.\n\nLamb loin was cooked rare, tasted great, sauce was also pretty good. the meat portion here was ok, the sides were comically small. About two bites of zucchini and two bites of something else. Ridiculous.\n\nWe also had a couple Moscow Mules (they call them something fancier). Those were very good.\n\nThis restaurant has excellent service. I enjoyed my drink. I also thought the entrees tasted good. The serving sizes are very small, especially appetizers. \n\nThis is easily the most pretentious restaurant in Lafayette. The presentation and ingredients of the meals seem to be more important than the taste. $130 for an ok meal is not ok in Lafayette. \n\nFolie seems to have no set menu. I believe the last two restaurants to try that  model in Lafayette were Restauration & Heirloom. Those one-year experiments didn't end well. \n\nI do like the idea of rotating a portion of the menu, but by rolling the entire thing over, you can't appeal to the people who are....*ahem*...boring eaters. There is one in every group (and most couples). If you can't always offer a few items that have mass appeal you're going to have trouble keeping guests coming back in a small city like Lafayette. It would make more sense to me if they were to keep a few broad-appeal, perfected dishes on the menu and rotate the rest. \n\nThis restaurant seems like it would only make sense in a very large city. I don't see it making any sense whatsoever in Lafayette. It's borderline ridiculous, but I wish them the best. I would put the quality of the food on par with Black Sparrow or East End Grill, but at a much higher price point (but also with more weird ingredients)\n\nFood/Price would be three stars, but the service was great and drinks were good, so I felt compelled to go with four stars.",

      "text": "Husband and I dined here last Thursday and LOVED it! Can't BELIEVE such a perfect restaurant has come to Lafayette but, boy, are we grateful! The dining room is understated elegance; special but not stuffy. The service is exactly how I like it: attending to your needs without trying to make chit-chat. You feel cared for but not hovered over. \n\nAnd the food...the FOOD! All ingredients were the best they could be and each dish was prepared, not just thrown together. I had the trout and my husband had the steak; both were excellent and each was tender. We had a hot appetizer and a cold one. The  pickled vegetables were generous and each vegetable had been pickled differently, making a simple offering interesting to eat. The turnip soup recipe elevated this winter root veggie into something you could CRAVE. (I still can't believe I said that about a turnip!)\n\nWe ordered wine by the glass (it was a Thursday) and it was a generous pour.\n\nDidn't order dessert as we were full, but will go hungrier next time so we have room. The words \"chocolate panna cotta\" are calling to me.\n\nThe chef clearly has some big-city skills. We hope locals can appreciate him so he will stay. \n\nOur advice to locals? Forget the Bistro! Don't bother with Pure! Skip the noice at East End Grill! GO TO FOLIE and you'll have a new favorite!",

It was fairly empty when we arrived at 6:30, but by 7:00 it was pretty hopping. \n\nFood was great. I got the salmon and my gf got coq au vin. She clearly had the better dish, but mine was elevated and intriguing, combining unexpected flavors (green beans and pomegranate). I got the better dessert, a deconstructed cheesecake that was fun to work through. You can really see the chef thinking through the dishes in the menu, and that level of care added to the experience. \n\nWe'll definitely come back. Can't wait to see what they add to the menu!",

      "text": "There's a new fine dining option in Lafayette, and it's excellent.\n\nI went there with my wife, and liked it so much I took business associates there a few days later.\n\nThe bar is well stocked, with a wine and beer list that's not as big as some in town, but very well thought out. Wine options range from value bottles that would fit the budget of a grad student splurging on a once a quarter I can't stand ramen any more night to a wine aficionado looking for a good Rhone red. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable without being intrusive.\n\nThe dinner menu was concise and well thought out, a range of appetizers that'd be great to use as \"plates to share\" for a group. The entrees cover the range from beef to seafood to vegetarian. I've tried fried oysters and the pork belly confit. Both were very good, but the pork belly confit was a luscious, perfectly prepared bite of porcine goodness, balanced by a not too tart, not too sweet dollop of tomato jam. Companions raved about the carrot soup and the wedge salad.\n\nAs an entrée, the hanger steak was an excellent piece of beef, prepared (I'm pretty sure sous vide) and seared to perfection. The house pickled mustard grains popped in my mouth, adding just the right amount of bitter and acid to offset the round fatty flavor of the beef.\n\nThe duck breast was likewise very good. Maybe just slightly overdone, but it had juicy, tasty meat with crisp, nicely seared skin and most of the fat rendered out. The sour cherry and hazelnuts added some crunch and a little acid, it'd be the perfect dish with an Oregon Pinot Noir.\n\nI didn't try the scallops myself, but both nights I was there people at the next table raved about them, and they sure looked good. Have to save that for my next visit.\n\nI've tried one desert there, a classic profiterole, or as my mom used to call them, a cream puff. Folie's are fresh made pâte à choux pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce.\n\nI have only two quibbles. The front of the house staff were friendly and super eager to please, but still learning. I watched our server struggle with a corkscrew and wanted to help her, but she did get the job done. The second is that the salmon on the menu is farm raised. I'm sure that's an effort to keep prices down, but a chef this good deserves better material to work with. Go with Alaskan Kings guys.\n\nOverall, this is a restaurant that would make it in New York or Chicago, but at prices that won't bust a Lafayette budget. Highly recommend!",

Main Entrees: Hand Battered Chicken Tenders, CountryFried Chicken and the North Atlantic Fish were all really pretty good too! Wasn't sure when first looking at them as were pulling out of the bag but was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted fresh and great flavor. Will say only downfalls we found was Mac and Cheese sides were really flavorless and tasted like plain noodles and the chocolate cake was very disappointing. Cheesecake was enjoyable though. \nWould definitely try again.",

      "text": "I never cared for Scotty's, so had higher hopes for the new Wolfie's. We try to give new places a couple of chances. And we will here, too. \n\nFirst off -- great customer service for takeout ordering. The woman taking our order was friendly and patient with questions. She was a bit unfamiliar with the menu, but we worked through it. And upon arrival, the food was ready and everything was there. So props for that. \n\nDo wish they had curbside pickup parking. Would make things much more convenient. \n\nFood wise -- the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with pepper gravy was really tasty. Five stars. And the coleslaw was really good, too. \n\nSadly, the rest of the meal was less exciting. Shrimp tacos had plenty of shrimp, but it was not at all seasoned. There was an almost laughably small amount of avocado on each taco. Boom boom sauce was good, but the pico de gallo was overwhelmingly jalapeño. And that dominated every bit. It was like just eating a jalapeño straight with no flavor complexity at all. \n\nSimilarly the jalapeño creamed corn (a fried chicken side) had no other flavor. The sweetness of the corn does not come through at all. Nothing but jalapeño. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was dry and flavorless. It seemed like it might have a spicy kick to it, too? Or maybe our mouths were just burned by other dishes. Hard to say.",

Food was ready in about 20 minutes. Wish they had curbside pickup. \nThe food itself was decent. The blackened tilapia sandwich was good, with the boom boom sauce, but the fish and fries was not my favorite. On top of that, they separated the fish rather than leaving it whole. Definitely not a fan. Portion sizes were decent. Prices were okay but the food definitely didn't leave me wanting to come back for more.",

      "text": "A decent replacement for the favorite area burger house called Scotty's we had for many years at this location. Wolfies offers an enticing menu with good options however prices and food size are not as ideal as Scotty's offered despite the extensive beverage options, fantastic service, and accommodating atmosphere with a dirty monotone color pallet covering the ceiling and bricks all over the walls. Our best part was the bang bang shrimp app! Super tasty and perfectly made, follows by the lesser dishes, my ahi tacos and my friend's buffalo wrap. Both well thought out, presenting solid appetizing flavors and smells, but ultimately not serving up a massive win to keep us out of other near by places like Town & Gown, The Pint, or Red Seven. My buddy wasn't a fan of the powerful wasabi in my tacos even though I loved it exactly for that! We both agreed the Buffalo wraps were small for the price and oddly (unlike my wasabi treated tacos) lacked the bite buffalo should have. The sides were very nice, mac and cheese and coleslaw did us both well. Our drinks were also fine however my cucumber gin and tonic blew the doors off the desserts and everything else we got alongside our main dishes. Speaking of desserts, I completely forget either of our dishes except by the photos it looks like we tried the cookie and monkey bread. I seem to recall they were both average. Overall this feels like a grown up Buffalo Wild Wings! A few hits but would be better having a good group to enjoy the game, know the best dishes before hand, and figure out what will get us full before assuming $14 tacos is a packed dinner meal.",

When I heard that they have California burritos on their menu, I  had to get one. I was not disappointed! The burrito had a generous amount of meat (Pastor for me), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, and French Fries! The taste was amazing, but it was wrapped a little sloppily. My teenagers enjoyed their nachos supreme, and breaded tenderloin. \n\nWe called our order ahead of time, and it was ready in 15 minutes. I'm glad we did, because when we arrived to pickup, the order line was 4 cars deep (at 5pm on a Thursday!).

You can have it in different styles: over fries, in a cup, as a taco or quesadilla. We decided to try it over fries (also comes with queso, guac, jalapeños). The beef is very tender and resembles pulled meat. The birria reminded me of Indian beef curries that I've had but not as spicy. The combo of the birria over the fries was yummy. The guac in particular was fantastic and I liked that they didn't go crazy with the queso - just the right amount. \n\nOverall, this is a yummy dish and worth trying if you've never had it before, but I can't say I loved it. We will definitely be going back to try their burgers which so many people seem to love. \n\nService was great and the staff were super helpful.",

      "text": "I drove by a couple of weeks ago and saw a new tenant in the old shack, and I knew I had to stop in. After hearing a client talking about the food, that sealed it.\n\nNothing fancy, the Wicked Food Shack is just that, a shack serving wickedly good food. To order, you either use the walk-up window or drive-thru. The menu is fairly simple with burgers, hot dogs, tenderloin, fries, tacos, burritos, esquite (Mexican corn in a cup, I got to know it as elotes in Texas), and other goodies. The menu is ever expanding - look for some dessert items in the future. \n\nI had the stuffed burger, which comes with fresh cut fries. Cheddar cheese and chopped bacon are stuffed inside a hamburger patty and then cooked to perfection. Normally I don't order bacon on a burger because I don't get a good bite on a slice of bacon due to my weird uneven teeth. With the chopped bacon stuffed in the patty, I got all the bacon taste in each bite. No need for condiments on this burger, the juices do it all.\n\nThe thick fries are freshly cut, and the interior steams while in the fryer. The exterior is crispy while fluffy on the inside. \n\nI also had the chili cheese fries. The same fresh cut fries are slathered with cheese sauce and house made chili. Although not as spicy as I prefer, this chili will fit in well with the local palate. These fries would be a great snack when it's 10 degrees out.\n\nThe Wicked Food Shack is going into my lunch and dinner rotation, if just for the burgers and fries. I'm going to have to work my way through the menu.",

The main event here is the burgers. The Wicked Burger boasts a really tasty hamburger patty, pulled pork and bacon. I know, right? The fries were tasty and plentiful. We also tried a jalapeño burger, which was great. The menu looked great, too, with a chili dog that looks to set the bar for chili dogs, and all sorts of other tasty odds and ends. And to boot, we ate there on National Burger Day. Only in America, folks. Only in America.",

The Miso Spicy is the answer to cloudy days, rain, hunger, sunny days, fun times, friends, family, it is so good. I always get it and have tried about half the other but none gets me like Miso Spicy. I'm all for the sushi burritos too however they're quite expensive. It's a tidy little campus spot with fun interaction ordering through a robot. There's cubicles that some may enjoy but others will feel confined. Not much window space but good for my sister and I we had it all to ourselves. Glad to have another ramen spot to spread out the space!",

      "text": "Still the best ideal mix of value and quality I have ever found, updating my review since trying T&G over 20 times - tragic that some people have a minor issue with a dish and form an entire opinion for a restaurant. Sure the menu is small, location and atmosphere on a budget, and parking is awkward (was a coffee shop originally) - the thing is: we do this hold back with menus. We end up conflicted. One item jumps out and tempts but we normally play it safe and go for the burger or some familiar item right? But pasta sounds tasty, haven't had good pasta for a long time. Right?! We all do this game. Why? Because the typical corporate food disappoints us 80% of the time. This is why I love Town & Gown. I have been here so many times with many of my family, friends, friend's friends, and gone thru most of the menu, not one bad time yet. This is the restaurant that is all about trying pasta, salmon, lamb, and more! No more burgers and salads snickering at you because you picked the Reuben (so predictable). Never mind, bad example, the Reuben here is fantastic. But that pasta, salmon, appetizers, deserts - it's the classic French style proving the chef knows what he's doing. OK - the breakfast is overpriced (like most places) and if you have complaints (which obviously can happen we had a salad once with dry chicken) ask the staff to fix it! I always leave here wondering why people go to Longhorn, East End Grill, Bistro 501, and other high class restaurants. You'll spend at least $20 more and end up with way less food. I guess eating under a shiny chandelier is worth the extra money for some. For the rest of us, T&G is a breath of fresh air. It will be everything you hoped for. The desert is crazy good too! Cheesecake better than Cheesecake Factory and half the price! Tiramisu like a massive slab of chocolate concrete soaked in espresso drugs. Apple pie, no words for the apple pie. Chocolate cake ripe for gluten-free darkness. The dinner prices are double what they were a few years ago but even $15 for a large fancy Pacific fish is way cheap. I'm real glad to see a proper chef surviving amidst a nasty mix of cheap college feeders and corporate restaurants all throwing enough sodium in their food to fill your FDA daily dose. I've seen a lot of uncomfortable health articles on the issues of that excess processed sodium. Hope to see Town & Gown continue to show off what fresh ingredients and real food should taste like.",

      "text": "Being new in town, I was keen to try out a brunch place and this was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area. Got here around 1pm on a Sunday (we were a group of 6 with a dog). The waitress who initially served us seemed a bit frazzled and was slightly curt. We were asked to wait for about 5 minutes before a place outside became available.\n\nThe outdoor seating is really cute, lots of flowers and has a cozy feel. It definitely gets a little toasty but I'd highly recommend it, especially as I found that when waiting inside, the cooking/greasy smell from the kitchen wafts in and sticks to your hair and clothes. \n\nThe guy who served us was very polite and friendly. They serve big, yummy cups of coffee (I loved their coffee). This is what we got:\n1. Smoked salmon and croissant bennie: The smoked salmon was great. My only issue with this dish is that they pour hollandaise sauce over it as if it's gravy. Next time I'd just get this on the side so I can moderate how much I want over it. The hollandaise sauce was pretty decent, a little less thick than what I'm used to. The croissant bennie was yummy, but by the time you get through to it, it's completely soggy from all the hollandaise sauce. Eggs were perfectly done. \n2. T&G Reuben: Big portion. This was really yummy and well done. It comes with a side of their \"home fries\" which appear to be roast potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned, but quite oily. \n\nWould I go back? Yes. I'd really like to try out their other brunch items and lunch/dinner menu.",

She checked on drink refills and how we were enjoying our food after we had time to actually try it.  Well managed, clean, a spacious parking lot.  Egg dish, omelette were perfectly cooked. Good coffee.  Homemade cornbeef hash with mushrooms, onions, cheese was memorable.  Perfect location on the edge of Purdue campus. Looking forward to trying lunch or dinner.",

There are only a handful of options available on the weekends for brunch and after trying the dishes multiple times, I'm ready to change it up a bit. Other than that, the place is delicious!",

      "text": "I really want to like this place more, but have had some issues.  I like their menu.  I love all the salmon options they have for breakfast.  Their breakfast menu is more brunch-like in style.  There are very few places to brunch in Lafayette and West Lafayette and, those that do offer brunch, usually only do so on Sundays so I like the idea I can get a brunch quality meal any day of the week here.\n\nPrices for food and drinks were reasonable.  My issue is that the food is inconsistent and not just between days where perhaps there may be a different chef, but on the very same day!  My first visit I ordered the smoked salmon eggs benedict and my friend ordered the homemade corned beef hash.  My eggs benedict arrived and they were SWIMMING in hollandaise sauce!  Now I though I loved hollandaise sauce, but there's certainly such thing as too much of a good thing.  You could barely even see my meal beneath all the sauce!  I couldn't taste anything but the sauce!  Yet I noticed other benedicts that same visit that other people ordered and they had a normal amount of sauce on them.\n\nI tried my friend's homemade corned beef hash and it was delicious!  Lots of meat mixed with potatoes.  So, on my next visit, this is what I ordered.  Mine was nothing compared to hers though!  Whereas hers had lots of meat, mine was mostly potatoes.  I was very disappointed.\n\nWhen running successful restaurant, the food must always be consistent.\n\nThe majority of the seating is upstairs.  I had wanted to take my father there, but will not because I do not think he could manage the staircase. The only options I see for downstairs seating is a patio (which would be fine in nice weather) or a couple of small tables just inside the front door where everyone checks in which doesn't look very cozy.  I'm not aware of more ample indoor seating downstairs.",

We were able to get a seat right away but they seated 3 of us at a 2 top. My guests order biscuits and gravy with fried eggs, fried eggs bacon and pancakes, I had a corned beef omelette and home fries.\nThe gravy \"an Indiana favorite\" was a brownish color instead of white which is actually an Indiana tradition. Both orders of eggs were over medium but both were cooked over easy. The omelette was pretty good but the nature of filling the eggs rather than cooking the ingredients with the eggs left it a bit flavorless even with the addition of hollandaise. \nServers all had stained untucked shirts which seemed a bit odd as a uniform.",

My major complain is the high price, typically $35-40 with order of two plates and soda/coffee drinks. \n\nToday, we ordered tax mex omelet and salmon croissant bennie. The food quality simply was not good enough for the price. The omelet's ingredient was sandwiched (not well mixed) meaning that all the spinach was jammed in the lower corner and each ingredient stacked next to each other. \n\nThe croissant bennie was very very salty.

The biscuits were good, but I don't like the brown kind of gravy. I like the standard white gravy. I didn't know it was the brown gravy if I had known I would've ordered something different. So, I ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it didn't look like what the other pictures on Yelp looked like. It looked like it was caked with chocolate sauce and cocoa powder. No, spoon imprint like the other pictures on Yelp. I've had tiramisu at other places this one had so much rum in it it wasn't good. It overpowered the entire dessert. The other food that had come out looked good and I've heard upstairs is more open and they have an open bar up there. I would try it again and order other items instead of the two I got.",

      "text": "We had such a wonderful birthday experience at Revolution Barbeque! Lafayette can sometimes feel like it's lacking in good, solid restaurants that know what they're doing, but I can say, whole-heartedly, that Revolution Barbeque has all the knowledge.\n\nWe sat-in the restaurant, despite their booming carry out service, and enjoyed our time with all of the other patrons. For a Thursday night, they were surprisingly busy! There is a main dining area and then a craft bar area to the other side of a bricked wall. We opted for the bar area which had some dimmer lighting and a moodier ambience. We were immediately greeted by the bartender and my partner ordered a special bourbon cocktail. Whoever made their cocktail menu definitely knows what they're doing, because you'd have assumed you were in Chicago or Nashville. A bit pricey for Lafayette standards when you're staring at the menu, but just bite the bullet and order the drink, because they're well worth it. Beautiful presentation and such a nice experience. I would say Revolution Barbeque would be a nice place to come and just have a drink, but... how could you resist NOT eating something?\n\nThe food came and we were so impressed. We had actually ordered 3 sides between the two of us, however they mixed up our orders with another tables and made good by correcting our order and providing us with an overall total of 5 different sides to try out! We had the mustard greens, the Mac and cheese, the baked beans, the slaw, and the potato salad. Now, I am probably the pickiest eater under the sun, but I can tell you, whoever is cooking this food knows how to make a damn good side. The sides with the waffle corn bread were outstanding. I mean, straight out of the south. And, at a BBQ place? To rave about their sides? That's saying something. I had never had mustard greens and they were stellar and something I'd eat any day. The baked beans were out of this world. The Mac and cheese was amazing. I don't know what was in the corn bread, but I can say it's safe to say that it should be illegal, because I'm sure it's highly addictive. \n\nI am not a meat person at all, however the BBQ was so rich in flavor and so finely crafted. I never eat an entire sandwich and I can say I downed mine within a couple minutes. Granted, it comes with a lot of meat, so I pushed a bit to the side! Now I have leftovers for this evening's meal. \n\nSuch a nice experience for a birthday meal and such a nice addition to downtown Lafayette. They have the sweetest and funniest staff who help you pick everything you want, and they have incredible food with great drinks and a fun environment. If I could give 10 stars, I would.",

We loved the sauce, tasted like strawberries on the front end and then hit you with the heat. We opted for the creamy slaw and potato salad as our sides.

The bar looks super cool too!\nWe started with Whiskey + Cherry Coke and Winter Sangria slushees, and they were amazing! Wonderful flavors and the consistency was perfect.\nFor dinner, we shared one of their platters -- the pulled pork, but we also added the brisket to it. We got sides of potato salad and Mac n cheese. The platter came with Texas toast as well. Everything was DELICIOUS. The brisket and pork were more traditional -- slices of brisket and roughly pulled pork, which we really liked. The Mac n cheese was also....incredible. \nThe meal came with four barbecue sauces -- the mustard and strawberry jalapeño were my favorites, and my husband was happy with their original. They also had a hot barbecue option!\nThe bartender was our server and he was very attentive, making sure that our needs were met throughout the meal. All in all, it was a great experience!",

      "text": "I want to share an experience to let you know the kind of people that own this business. Out front of the bar side door is a metal plate covering a chute the goes to the basement for deliveries. In September my family chose to go to Revolution for lunch. 5 of us. As we walked, my 70 year old mother hit the plate wrong and fell in to the chute, dropping 2 feet in to the ground, and seriously bruising her arm (which was x-rayed last month and STILL has a large lump under the skin). \n\nThe bartender cam running out, and SAW my mother in the whole. The street crew doing maintenance across the street also saw, and two pedestrians came running to help her. The bartender went to get the owner. There were 6 eye witnesses. \n\nThe female owner came out and looked at the plate and kept saying that \"she just didn't see how that could possibly happen,\" and kept insinuating that this was my mother's fault that their pitfall in THEIR property was not secured. I have included pictures of the plate that were taken later that week when you can see they were attempting to fix it. This was one of the days of outdoor dining downtown, and there are no cones or anything marking this hazard. \n\nUnbeknownst to this woman I WORKED in this same building when it was another restaurant, and it was always a concern someone would be hurt on this plate. One person had fallen in before. \n\nThe owner went about downplaying the incident, and saying she just didn't understand, and she would need to talk to her husband. We had to FORCE HER to take our number. \n\nHer husband never did show up. She never owned she was at fault (even after my mother said she would never press charges because her father had owned a small business). She didn't comp the lunch (which was marginal at best), she didn't comp half the lunch, she gave us three pieces of pie and never said another word. \n\nThey never called to express concern, or follow up. She could have sued Revolution and the city, but she didn't. Even after two injuries that could have been very serious had she completely gone down the keg chute. These are not good people. Do not give them your money. You can make BBQ just as good at home and not give a profit to unkind people.",

      "text": "Exquisite urban environment with lots of space and very family oriented staff. My buddy and I tried out Revolution for the first time this week and overall had decent things to say. Thankful that the prices don't take advantage but noticed that my buddy's order of ribs surprisingly made it out of the kichen, extremely fatty and lacking flavor, required a lot more digging and scraping then restaurant ribs I have become used to that rather fall off the bone with a few pokes and nibbles. Surprisingly Cheddar's comes to mind as some of the best ribs in the area. He should have ordered the pork or copied me for briscut! My 8oz was tender, nicely seasoned, soft enough, quite generous with the sides too unlike *cough* the new Ripple place nextdoor *cough* - I made the silly rookie mistake of saying beans for a side meaning the green beans but ended up with the basic beans. Would have been fine but the heavy beans along with my wonderful thick chili made for rich sides, filling n all but I'll do the slaw next time. I sampled the potato salad, rave reviews easy! The bar area is a splendid mix of classy and neat, great specialty slushies for the refined adult still trying to grow up. Of course I got the whiskey root beer! So good! Stuff of pool parties in fancy beach houses, a good size too, overall fitting well with the meats. Ended with an apple pie because they were out of banana cream (weeping), crust was very crusty and filling quite sweet, still easy to eat. Despite the weird turnout with the ribs, we both agreed we will have to come back and sample more of the menu to make sure the ribs were not just a fluke.",

      "text": "Finally got to try Revolution BBQ! I came here for lunch with a friend. We had both heard great things and wanted to avoid the dinner rush. I've heard they can get super busy. Atmosphere is great! Lots of space in the building. Industrial feel and cool bar area. Menu is nice, with some delicious sounding appetizers and sides. I had the brisket taco, pork BBQ taco, Mac-n-cheese, and featured lemonade. Damn. The Mac-n-cheese was spot on. Tacos were very good, but I liked the pork one the best.\n\nSauces are tasty, but wanted more heat. Strawberry habanero is not spicy at all. My friend had the smoked chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, and a bourbon pecan chocolate pie to go. She enjoyed her food. They make house buns for sandwiches! Overall, awesome experience. Highly recommend.",

As first time guests we got the beignets half off and they were AMAZING. We had the eggs Blackstone benedict, cinnamon roll French toast which came with side of eggs and the southwest omelet. This was a great balance of sweet and flavory for 2 people ( maybe too much). Will be visiting again for outdoor seating now that the weather is nice.",

They are doing a good job following COVID protocols. The best part is the food. They have so many good choices it was hard to choose! We started with a plate of the bomb complimentary beignets and awesome coffee. Our table had the Southwestern Scramble without the andouille, the Croissant French Toast, the Cinnamon Roll French Toast and the Salmon Bowl. Everything was fresh and amazing! We were a little rushed so our server packed up part of it to go. She was incredibly accommodating. Really enjoyed this meal. I would highly recommend it!",

After 4 years of attending Purdue, I decided to try Another Broken Egg Cafe and was extremely impressed.\n\nPositives\n\n-Food: The food is incredible with flavors and combinations that you really can't get anywhere else. The vibe is Cajun with many of the dishes having crawfish, anduille, shrimp, etc, but they also have traditional fares for anyone. The chefs really put craft into their dishes.\n\n-Service: It's tough to get a table on the weekends, but the staff is super nice. Our waitress was very accommodating, kept refills coming promptly, and aided in our questions on the menu.\n\n-Drinks: They have really good coffee, brunch cocktails, and specialty coffee/sweet drinks for anyone to enjoy.\n\nNegatives\n\n-Price: While the food is quite good, the price is pretty steep for most college students or really anyone getting brunch/breakfast. Most dishes are 12-18$, coffee 3.50$, and specialty drink 5+$ vs the typical 6-10$ fares at many diners around. The ingredients reflect the price, but usually that spend is reserved for nicer dinners for most people.",

My daughter wanted to stay on or close to campus so she suggested Another Broken Egg. I'll confess that I had already selected another restaurant in West Lafayette and had even selected my beverage snd entree so I was silently disappointed. We walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and seated. Our waitress, Cheyenne, was great. She suggested many of the house favorites. I settled on the seasonal corned beef, Brussels, and blistered tomatoes topped with two over easy eggs. My was I surprised how good my meal was! The eggs were perfectly cooked with crispy edges. The yolk blended beautifully with the corned beef, potatoes, and veggies. There was a dollop of sour cream that brought all together so well. My husband had the chicken fried steak Benedict, which he said was good and my daughter had the salmon Benedict that she said was good but had a tad too much seasoning salt. Over all we had a great breakfast that did not disappoint.",

I don't understand if these waitresses can't hear or what but coconut cream is not milk and no eggs does not mean eggs.

They were very busy which I expected on a Sunday so I did use the Yelp app to reserve a spot in line which was awesome and they sat us down almost immediately. My server seemed very unknowledgeable about the menu and what it offered. I asked if they did any flavored iced coffees and she said she wasn't sure and she'd check. She just brought me a very iced down coffee with little flavor that I wasn't thrilled about. Gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she's new and that's fine. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my mom had an omelet. The food came and while it looked amazing the taste just wasn't.. my eggs were cold and the flavors were just okay. My mom said her omelet seemed very over done and wasn't too happy either. My favorite part was the complimentary pancake beignets. Those were soft, hot and yummy but we didn't get them until after paying for our bill. \n\nWhile I didn't enjoy this first time experience, I do think it was just a busy day and maybe I didn't order the best they had to offer. I would still come back and try something new maybe sometime.",

Everyone was very pleasant to work with.\n\nWe ordered the lobster Brie and cheese omelet and broken egg biscuit sandwich. Both plates were generous and filling. The omelet was extremely rich. It was savory and very decadent with the Brie, cream cheese and loads of lobster. Accompanying it was a generous cup of fresh fruit. The sandwich wasn't a pick up and eat lunch, rather neat but eaten best with a fork and to really indulge, order it with an extra side of gravy! The sandwich was an over size biscuit with a chicken tender on it covered it n Country gravy! Oh buddy, this is Nirvana after a day tailgating if you know what I mean!   ;  ) \n\nThe coffee was a hearty cup. Not the lightweight wussy stuff watered down by so many places. It is hyper sized on the caffeine. \n\nThe only negative is that the wait is sooo long when smelling what is cooking. My advice is if you are reading this on yelp, put your name on the list in advance and reduce your wait time, it's worth both the wait and the food!",

The biscuits were fluffy, but that gravy was just wrong. I took it to work and gave it to a coworker. My friend ordered the pound cake French toast with eggs and sausage. She was really happy with it, as well as the banana fosters syrup. She did not like the sausage.

      "text": "Summary: Food seems a little hit-and-miss; great service.\n\nMy first time at Another Broken Egg Cafe. Came here with my husband on a Sunday around mid-morning for brunch. The wait was about 30 minutes long and we were seated at one of the high tables. \n\nI decided to try out one of their seasonal specials (Southern Benedict with potatoes) as they were going to be taking this off the menu shortly. My husband got the Chilaquiles. \n\nI can't recommend the Southern Benedict. The biscuit was dry and really bland, one poached egg was done well but the other was overcooked. The sausage was really good but there was way too much ham (that too very salty!) to really appreciate the flavours of the dish. The side of potatoes was pretty average, couldn't really taste any seasoning. Overall a pretty disappointing dish. We did inform our waitress about the salty ham and she took our feedback very well.  \n\nThe chilaquiles on the other hand was definitely better. Well garnished. I thought it was a little meat-heavy but some people may really enjoy this. \n\nCoffee: Not the greatest. And was lukewarm when served.  \n\nBecause it was my first time we got treated with their classic sugar dusted beignets which were an absolute delight! \n\nWould I go back? Yes, to try out their other dishes before settling on a final verdict.",

      "text": "Yes! YES! YEEEAAAASSSSSS!!!!!\n\nBefore reviewing the food let me tell you this was the best breakfast / brunch experience since Ruby Slipper in my home state of Louisiana, that's in New Orleans. \n\nThis was and is the best meal I've had before noon in 4 years! That includes my own cooking and I'm pretty damn awesome. Despite being a franchise whomever is training and implementing the hospitality is spot on SOUTHERN CHARM. Friendly and not just our waitress Cheyenne, the Manager Seth and every single employee I saw was smiling and being friendly. Only one waitress complaining about a table that had been finished with their meal for quite some time. I get it though, these folks make their money turning tables. Let me explain what this joint gets that others miss...the second, third and fourth visits that end up making you willing to wait 45 minutes for the best experience in the area. I will and gladly.\n\nSo on this occasion we used the yelp waiting list function for the first time. Wait estimate was 22 min and it took us about 20 minutes to arrive from the east side. We arrived and within a few minutes of arriving were sent a text and seated. \n\nLet me be honest, I wanted to hate it on the drive there. Another knock off want to be NOLA restaurant claiming southern cuisine. \"Flashback\" walking up to the hostess I heard chubby checker (my moms favorite), and in front of me was a hutch that my grandmother had; I scowled. \n\nHere we are looking over the menu, which I was delighted was not the same paper menu that we first grabbed on arrival. I simply decided to choose my normal routine, first visit breakfast. Here is was the supreme omelette, which as offered was what I was raised on. Eggs, sausage, bacon, onions, mushrooms and Colby jack (gods omelette cheese). I added a 1/2 biscuit and gravy as well as grits. J had the chicken and waffles with home fries. \n\nDrinks arrive and the Bloody Mary needed some pepper and a splash of pepper sauce to meet my perfectionist standards. J orders a strawberry mimosa because I neglected to inform her that we were drinking early. Both perfect as well as the strong coffee that I sipped.\n\nFood arrives and NEWS FLASH; we had to add seasoning to nothing!!!! \n\nFirst time visitor gets some perks (this is the well placed hook) FREE biscuit beignets arrive and I was skeptical despite J trying and loving them. They are different but delicious and if you omit the orange marmalade then you are void of taste buds.  \n\nThe freaking omelette, my mèmè would have loved this. The biscuits and sausage gravy!?!? Tender fresh biscuits with amazing sausage gravy (best in Indiana).  The grits were a little bouisey (diced tomatoes green onions and bacon). I pushed that aside for grits only... OMG perfect. Second bite with the bouisey topping; eye rolling and delightful. English Muffin with a light smear of butter to sop up lost bits and it, too was perfect.\n\nSpeaking for J as she ate some of mine as usual!!  I tried her Chicken and Waffles with Chipotle Honey on the side. It was her first chicken and waffles and she asked me how to eat it and I offered my opinion which was a fail. So the chipotle honey is a strong honey with slight chipotle kick. Independent of the sauce, she loved it. \n\nThe honest final comment is everything on the menu speaks to my southern soul and if you find yourself trapped in Lafayette, Indiana, you should make your way to this place and piss us all off because the seating is perfect but there is already a wait! \n\nBTW, the music and ambiance was great the entire meal!",

      "text": "tldr: The food here is solid/fine, like you'd expect at a breakfast diner. But the prices are more like restaurant level rather than cheap diner level. The result is a fairly satisfying breakfast for more money than I'd expect to spend.\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared a plate of plain French toast, which was not great (not hot, rubbery). We also shared a seafood omelette, which was good (lots of shrimp, pretty big, sauce on top). This came with an English muffin (like the French toast, not hot), a small bowl of grits (fine, plain), and a piece of ham (nice flavor). We were supposed to get a side of bacon too but only got one strip. Weird? She also got coffee and we spent $35 with tip. So again it's not like the food was bad, but it was just okay for that much money.\n\nThey do have a nice feature on the menu of writing how many calories each dish has.\nThis is helpful for portion control!\n\nWe went on a Saturday morning around 9am and it was not busy (we were seated right away). By 10 or so it got a bit crowded.",

      "text": "This is a cute little breakfast place adjacent to the Purdue campus (located, conveniently, across the street from the Armstrong Building). It's busy for brunch, so there is a wait to get seated, but otherwise service is friendly and speedy. My server,  Brianna, was very nice and had great timing. They definitely earn their tips here! I got a Cranberry Mimosa, which was tart and tasty and perfect for the humid and rainy morning. I ordered Shrimp and Grits for my meal-it's a southern themed restaurant. The actual grits themselves are plain and overly bland, but a good texture. The accompanying sauce and baby shrimp/ sausage add the perfect amount of spice, and the garlic bread pancake things on the side are buttery and tasty. Worth the wait!",

Admittedly this is a low bar, as breakfast sucks pretty much everywhere. We are breakfast connoisseurs, and heretofore we have found nothing but mediocrity. No more.\n\nIt's called \"Another Broken Egg Cafe\" and its on Northwestern Avenue, across from the Physics building. The crowds are deserved and the prices (no student budget here) well-earned. If you arrive after 9A on a weekend morning, prepare to wait for a table. And that was before this posting.",

      "text": "An absolute delight when it comes to breakfast and brunch classics. I went here for the first time this morning, and the interior instantly charmed me, with its red walls and modern decour, and the waitresses were the most friendly I have ever come across anywhere so far. I was asked if I had ever been there before, strangely, but I was soon enlightened that new customers got a free half-order of their mini-beignets, which further reinforced my good first impression. Beignets are hard to find anywhere outside of the south, and while their mini ones didn't quite stack up to a full-sized beignet, they were delicious nonetheless (though hard to eat neatly with a beard and black clothing, on account of the powdered sugar).\n\nIt was hard choosing what I wanted from their posh and delectable-sounding items, like bananas foster pancakes, chocolate-ganache stuffed waffles, sweet potato waffle, lemon blueberry goat cheese pancakes, cinnamon roll french toast, lobster and brie omelette, chicken and waffles -- on and on. I decided to be adventurous with the unique \"crab cake benedict,\" though, described as jumbo crab cakes served on an English muffin, topped with poached eggs, an \"Andouille-infused\" hollandaise sauce, and served with a side of potatos or grits. I don't often associate fish (except for smoked salmon) with breakfast, and crab cakes are always a risky business anyways (you can either be served a very good one, or else one that gives you the runs six hours later because of food poisoning). \n\nFortunately, there was no fishy business -- the crab cake was tender and went surprisingly well with the poached egg and hollandaise sauce (which had actual Andouille sausage in it, far from just being \"infused\"). The potatoes were acceptable -- a little dry, and my only gripe was that there was ~$1.30 charge extra for them putting cheese and bacon bits on them, which was not made known to me when it was offered while ordering. I'd say you should probably go for the grits instead. At any rate, I will certainly be returning, and hopefully I will have just as excellent an experience as I explore their other options.",

The actual food however was very disappointing. I ordered the Floridian Omelet with potatoes and English muffin. The omelets flavor seemed to get worse with each bite. The combination of crab and cheese just didn't seem to work together in flavors, at least for me. There was also just a huge glob of cream cheese in the middle. So big that it was room temp at best while the rest of the omelet was hot. I tried to eat it all because It's the most expensive omelet I have ever bought, I just couldn't manage it.  My photos are how far I got. The omelet was big and the egg part of it was wonderful the flavors just didn't seem to go together.\n\nI was extremely disappointed in the omelet. The potatoes and English muffin were good but I didn't receive any condiments for them (I should have thought to ask)\n\nI wouldn't suggest to anyone I know to eat here but I also wouldn't caution them away. For the price and other reviews I have read I was expecting some amazing food but was sadly disappointed.",

      "text": "I'm not quite sure how to describe the location of where this restaurant is at because I'm not to familiar with the Lafayette area. However it seemed like this restaurant was somewhat attached to a community center, play park, apartment, study area, and church. There is plenty of parking and areas to sit outside which was nice, especially in the summer months. \n\nThe menu isn't too crazy big so it won't make it too difficult to choose what you want to eat. However I would recommend the mushroom pizza as it is refreshing and light tasting as there isn't red sauce on it. White sauce pizzas are one of my favorites and this little cafe did not disappoint. I shared this pizza and a Caesar salad with one person and it was plenty of food for a lunch time meal. We even had some pizza left over. The fresh greens on top of the pizza added such a nice touch which was wonderful. There wasn't anything special about the salad, I would just say it tasted pretty classic. But it was good that is for sure. \n\nI also noticed the huge study area that is attached to this Café which was closed at the moment due to COVID19 however I can imagine that this is a hot place to study because there were a lot of places to sit and even private room areas for silent study.",

      "text": "Wow! What a great place to grab lunch when in West Lafayette.  About a mile north of Purdue, this place was packed on a Tuesday.  I found the last parking spot in their lot and headed inside.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating.  I placed my order at the front counter and after paying, gave my name and waited for the pickup counter to call it out.  Not the most efficient if people have the same name, but the food came out so quickly that as long as I was paying attention, I could get my food in hardly no time!  Fortunately, there were plenty of seats inside, so I sat down with my selections.  \n\nI went with the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and the Red Skin Potato Salad as my choice for a side.  The sandwich comes served on a rustic Italian bread (fairly thick) and the chicken salad was about an inch deep across the sandwich!  No skimping here!  The sandwich had just hint of blue cheese for depth to go with the dried cranberries, walnuts, lettuce, and Roma tomato slices.  Very hearty and flavorful!\n\nThe potato salad was excellent!  Instead of a mustard base, this creamy coating tasted more like butter.  The potatoes were diced and al dente for a nice bite, not mushy.  Just right for me!\n\nThe price for both options was under $10, so very reasonably priced for the amount of food offered.  I highly recommend this combo.\n\nOh, and before I forget, the walls are covered with text.  Some are informational, some inspirational, and others humorous.  It gave me something to look at while waiting for my order or while eating since I was dining by myself.\n\nNote:  The customers are expected to clear their own tables and deposit the dishes and trash at a station by the door.  The staff does come by and clean the tables as well.\n\nReview #283",

Other reviews made it sound like it gets busy around lunchtime, but I had no issues finding empty tables on a saturday afternoon. I loved how quiet it was and it was a nice place to work. I would have liked to say comfy place to work too, but they have limited comfortable seating. Wifi was good. \n\nI got the almond milk latte and a Mediterrano Pizza (based on employee recommendation as the best pizza they have - see picture). I felt that both the latte and the pizza were just mediocre. Nothing to keep coming back for. I've heard their panini's are good, but that will have to be a future review. Prices would have been reasonable if the food tasted a little better. \nI also have to say that the folks working behind the counter were very nice and courteous.",

      "text": "I was in town visiting some friends at Purdue, and they suggested that we go here for brunch. It is in a good location, and the inside is very bright and airy. Rather than table service, you order the food and pick it up at the counter, so if you're looking to go somewhere to eat and really be able to talk with friends this is a good place to go. I think the food and prices matched pretty well, but the reason for my 3 stars was because of a pineapple situation. That sounds really weird, I know, but I am allergic to pineapple, so I asked about what fruit came in the seasonal fruit cup. Being allergic to pineapple sucks because it's so yummy, but I just can't have it. They said that there is pineapple in the fruit cup, so I asked if I could have double of whatever other fruit they were feeling instead of pineapple. When I got my fruit cup, they ended up still putting pineapple in it and charging me for a whole other fruit cup even though my sandwich was supposed to come with one. I was really confused and also worried because if someone was more allergic than me and ended up with pineapple, that could be a really big problem :( \n\nThe food and coffee were good, but I was a bit put off by the whole experience when I went up to the counter to tell the person ringing what happened and she seemed very reluctant to have the manager come over to try to do a refund. I ended up just passing it off and deciding that I probably wouldn't go back.",

      "text": "In town on business and heard about Cafe Literato and checked it out for lunch. This is definitely a spot that I would both recommend and return to if I were local. The restaurant is open and just a nice space. I liked that you order at the counter and then head up to the pass to get your food from the kitchen.\n\nI had the Brick Oven Pork sandwich and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. The sandwich was really good but what put it over the top was that Italian batard bread. Wow. Nice and light/crispy on the outside and soft and moist inside. While the pork was good, all I kept thinking about was replacing the smoked pork with some really good porketta. It would be just killer on that bread. Either way, I'd suggest they hit the sandwich with some pan drippings because the only drawback was that the pork was a little dry. Not to fear, I was dunking it in the bisque, which was delicious...rich, flavorful, and with little bits of crushed tomato left over from the blending process. So good. \n\nI'd probably head back there tomorrow but have other joints to patronize and try out while I'm here.\n\nThanks, Literato, for a great lunch.",

Order at the counter, find a table.\n\nThe menu offered lots of expected beverages, including smoothies and baked goods, sandwiches, salads and soups. Ordered an all-veggie grilled sandwich and appreciated the offering: eggplant, zucchini, peppers.  Unfortunately, the tomato soup was sweet and cloying, and the grilled cheese just ok. Mango smoothie was a hit. A good place to meet friends but not the food we'd hoped for.",

It was spotless & you could literally smell the cleaning products they used when you walk in the door. Obviously, with COVID, that's much appreciated. I ordered grape leaves (came with 2), a bowl of lemon rice soup, a side of falafel (came with 6) with tzatziki, and cheese pie. All of this, plus a 20% tip, was only $16!! I had maybe a couple of bites of the soup because I was already stuffed from everything else, but I couldn't recommend it enough. Soup- perfect. Cheese pie- best I've ever had. Tzatziki- delicious & homemade. Grape leaves- flavorful & tender. Falafel- not my favorite but I'm pretty picky when it comes to falafel. Would 100% eat here again. Customer service was great & they had my order ready FAST. Next time I want to try the spinach and cheese pie & see how it compares to the cheese pie.",

The pita was fine, but the meat was a bit tough and fatty and tzatziki sauce was watery and clumpy. I much prefer both the chicken and tzatziki at Captain Gyro's. I did like that this sandwich came with cucumbers in addition to tomatoes and onions. We shared Greek fries. The fries themselves were pretty mediocre but I did like the feta and seasonings on top. The fries were about a dollar more than the online menu says, which always annoys me. My husband had the combo platter (which was expensive - $17 - but came with a lot of food) and he was more pleased with the food than I was.",

The menu covers Irish favorites like Guiness stew, Shepherd's pie, fish and chips, etc. but also has fish tacos, burgers, mussels, etc. Everything that I've eaten here has been good. \n\nOn the down side, it is pretty noisy and, even with their overflow parking lot, parking sucks. \n\nMost recently, we hosted a party of 14 here. They were very accommodating and welcoming from the initial phone call. They put our group on the patio which has a roof, heaters, tent-like sides. The patio was quieter than inside and was warm even on a cold rainy night. Great service for a large party.",

I would recommend the fish and chips, Reuben, shepherd's pie, and Pot of Gold's. \n\nPrices are a little bit more expensive than the rest of West Lafayette, but you are paying for quality.

So glad we did -- given social distancing -- as that leaves just two intimate booths available. We enjoyed cocktails, dinner salads, stuffed mushrooms appetizer, prime rib entree (requested a lean cut) and salmon entree served Oscar style. Everything was positively top notch and delicious!!\nOur server / bartender, Ryan, was simply delightful -- so friendly and she even gave courtesy chuckles to my hubby's dad jokes! \nLooking forward to dining again at MJ's on our next road trip north!",

Desserts change and they bring you a platter to view before you order, which is classy. Mom-Thurs they have early bird specials which include an entree and side. Check those out from 5-6pm. Hade the rare prime rib special, broccoli and added a salad. Delicious! I love it when I order a rare piece of beef and it actually comes out rare. \n\nThis place is always classy.

      "text": "Can I give this place 4+ stars ? Like maybe 4.5 stars. They really pulled through on getting us in on Christmas Eve for our reservation. We had been calling for 3 days and it just kept going to an automatic answer, which you could not leave a voicemail on. We tried calling during their business hours after 5pm and again no answer... same auto answer. We finally went online and tried to put in a reservation. Someone called us back the next day and fit us in. The atmosphere is lovely. Several fireplaces, and I love how it has a coat check next to the entrance. This is Lafayette's finest dining restaurant. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter told us the restaurant opened in 1977. This place is a classic.\n\nMost meals come with soup or salad. We got the house salad. They used to make it in front of you. Now, instead, you have to tell them what you want on the salad. You can also add bacon and/or mushrooms. Trust me, add the bacon !  They give you plenty and the flavor is amazing ! It's more like finely chopped ham than bacon. They have several house-made dressings. I got the red wine vinegar creamy dressing. Very yummy ! I got the crab cakes to start off.  They were fresh-made, but I think they used the canned crab with alot of breading. The flavor reminded me of a salmon patty. Decent, but not the lump-crab meat patties that I'm used to. My best friend got the prime rib rare. This is supposedly what they are known for. It comes with an au ju sauce and house-made horseradish cream sauce. I also got the largest prime rib. It was 1.5lbs and bone-in steak. The knife I was given was not sharp and they had to trade it out. I guess these are the same ones from the 70s lol. It was good, but even with the replaced knife I had to work too hard to saw into the meat in order to cut it into pieces. My husband got the Ribeye. He had ordered it medium well, but it came out medium. He liked it fine. Definately get the augratin potatoes as your side !  They are cheesy and delicious !!! Another person in our group got the NY Strip. He had ordered it rare and it came out medium well. He sat for quite a while (We were 1/4 complete with our meal) before the waiter finally checked back and then put in an order to replace his steak. The waiter was a bit of a smarty pants. He kind of had an attitude like, .... well I'll work here if I must. Lol  Supposedly, this place is known for their mud pie, but we didn't have enough room for dessert. Total bill was about $100 for 2 people including wine and an appetizer. This is a nice place to have a romantic evening.",

      "text": "I wish that I wore a nicer shirt. ;)\n\nThis restaurant was recommended by the front desk staff at a nearby hotel. Overall, I do not have any complaints about my dinner at Mountain Jack's. \n\nI dropped by for an early dinner and grabbed a seat at the bar to have a nice, 'romantic' dinner alone. *I'm not sure if I really had a choice with my seating.* The steak menu is pretty vast. Since I had steak the night before, I was debating between the Mahi tuna or pork chop. *When I was a kid, I was told to never order fish from a steakhouse, so I went with the pork chop for this visit.* Before starting, I went for the crabcake as my appetizer. The crab cakes were just ok. I think that I would have preferred them without the dill sauce because the sauce seemed to drown out the flavor of the crab cakes. My main course, the sweet and sour porks chop, was pretty fascinating. After dinner, I was presented with a tray of super-rich desserts, however, I was far too full from dinner to order a dessert. Looking back, I wish that I had skipped the crab cakes so I would have had more room for a dessert. \n\nThe bartender, who also served as my waitress since I was at the bar, was very friendly and prompt.\n\nIf im back in the Lafayette area, I would give Mountain Jack's a second try. I'll just be sure to wear a nicer shirt for my next visit.",

We haves dined with family in the main dining room and on my anniversary in the bar area. Stepping into the bar is like going back in time and experience the 50's and not in a bad way. I have never in 8+ visits had a bad experience. You will pay for it in the pocket book so be prepared; it's worth it.\n\nI will update this post with pictures and update the review when I visit again. In the mean time this is currently the only place I send people for the best steak and experience in Lafayette. That's not to say I don't have another go to; but let's be honest, Texas Roadhouse is nation wide and I never recommend that even though I eat it. \n\nC'est si bon",

We loved everything on the sample platter but especially the sauce the shrimp were in. It was like a spicy kind of buffalo sauce but not buffalo sauce. I can't describe it but it was sooo good!!!\nWe all got the table salad not only was it yummy it was actually pretty fun having it made at the table. My daughter doesn't eat red meat so she got the Barramundi fish. I tried it. It had great flavor with a very soft texture. My husband got the porterhouse steak and he said it was the best he's ever had. He eats his med rare so, I didn't try it but he definitely doesn't say something is the best if it's not. I got the ribeye. It was tender with amazing flavor and a nice crisp outside. Loved it! I almost don't have words for their delicious homemade bread. I believe it may be a sour dough. Oh my, this could be dangerous for me if we lived closer! \nI've only eaten at two restaurants in Lafayette. One was East End Grill and now Mountain Jack's. I liked East End Grill...especially their truffle fries but there's no comparison to Mountain Jack's. Mountain Jack's is by far the winner! Their prices were very reasonable as well.",

This ended up being the waiter rolling a cart up to the table, on top of which was a platter with lots of cups filled with salad mix-ins. \n\nThe tableside salad bar is a nice touch. Everyone can pick and choose what they want without leaving their seats.\n\nContinuing with the items Mountain Jack's seems to be known for, I chose the prime rib. This is listed as being \"award winning,\" herb crusted and slow roasted overnight. \n\nAnd it was OK -- not the best and not the worst prime rib I've had. It was a little tougher in parts, but the spices on it worked well.\n\nThe rest of my family generally enjoyed their meals. Considering we have a variety of tastes, it was good to find a restaurant we all could find something at. It was also convenient that this restaurant is so close to the interstate.",

      "text": "Mountain Jack's was a nice place to celebrate a birthday on a Sunday evening. We called a few hours before for a reservation and when we arrived we were greeted with a friendly face and we were asked I a very kind tone what we were celebrating. We were immediately seated at a table with menus and water. We were then tended to quickly and ordered appetizers and drinks. We ordered the cocktail shrimp and the potato skins. The potato skins were decent, kind of hard to mess up, but also didn't seem to have a ton of flavor. The shrimp was prepared well and were served 6 jumbo shrimps. They were good size. The sauce was not spicy enough for us, so we asked for more horseradish on the side. We are in love with St. Elmo's shrimp cocktail and so we like it hot! I ordered the whiskey glazed salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and onion strings. The entrees also came with a choice of soup or salad. The soup of the day was split pea soup with bacon and also offered French onion. I got the opted for the caesar salad and it was alright. The French onion soup was very much so French ONION soup, as there were tons of onion in the soup. I found the soup very sweet and the salad subpar. The  salmon was flaky and cooked well. It was very very salty and ended up scraping most of the glaze off. The mashed potatoes were alright, again not great but decent. The steaks were cooked well and everyone was impressed with the portion sizes for the price. We were also given a complementary dessert since we were celebrating a birthday. They brought us a huge slice of their mud pie and it was delicious. We also ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse pie as well and everyone seemed to prefer the mud pie. We did have an egg allergy and the desserts did have egg. Overall it was nice for Lafayette/West Lafayette.",

It came with two sides plus a salad. That's a lot of food for $25. And it was so delicious, far better than the more expensive fare at the numerous chain steakhouses in the area. \n\nIt's a nice decor. Much more intimate and a bit more old fashioned than the nearby competition. Their bar is stocked with several fantastic bourbons, liquors and craft beer bottles. And I haven't even mentioned the great and polite service. All in all a great find that I'll be sure to revisit. And I still can't get over the fantastic price!",

      "text": "I'm torn between an \"as good as it gets\" 5 star and a \"yay!  I'm a fan\" 4 star.  I mean, it's Lafayette - it's literally the only Thai restaurant, so it is literally as good as it gets.  That said, it's also delicious, although the menu lacks a couple of items (mainly in the dessert category) that I'd like to see.\n\nI've been a few times - both eating in and taking out.  I'm a consistent Thai diner - I always get pad see ew with tofu (essentially, a thick, floppy noodle with a lot of soy, with tofu), and -- if they have it -- sweet sticky rice with custard.  Because I'm boring like that, my eating experience is consistent, and tasty.  Aside from the lack of sticky rice.\n\nIn terms of dining in, it's a perfectly pleasant experience.  That said, the restaurant itself (at least the eating area) is fairly small, so if you're planning on coming on a busy night, you're probably going to feel rather cramped.  I generally get take out on busy nights, and dine in on a casual Tuesday.\n\nI see another review suggesting that the staff was rude, and the portions small.  I haven't had that experience.  The portions are appropriate for one meal - you're not going to walk away hungry, and you're not going to need a box.  It's just right.  The staff seemed a bit harried, but that's pretty typical for a busy restaurant.",

He came storming out of the kitchen with a plate of fried rice and proceeded to chew me out for ordering it without onions... the food he just made was going to go to waste  it was my fault, I was inconsiderate, etc. right after ordering, I asked the waiter to hold the onions, but apparently the dish had already been made. I would have been happy to pay for it, but he was too busy chewing me out in front of all the other diners to even hear that fact. We paid for soup and drinks and whatever else and will never return. It is a shame, as we have been dine-In and take-out customers since it opened. Can't support a business that treats customers like dirt. I honestly have never had such a horrible experience dining out.",

      "text": "I love Thai Essence to bits. I used to hop and the bus, stop off in front of the Medical Research Center place (the pyramid building), walk across the highway, just to eat there. It and Basil Thai have the same owner, and they have pretty much the same thing. However, Thai Essence's menu is more extensive than Basil Thai. Both do take-out, but no delivery. Additionally, I find portions at Thai Essence are bigger than at Basil Thai.\n\nMy favorite by far is that Thai Essence has a section called Hot Plates. More often than not have the Duck Pra Ram or the hot plate that has lychee, but honesty everything is good here. This is the foremost place I take people if they haven't gone there before. It's more upscale, an actual restaurant versus a mom & pop shop.\n\nIf you're looking to impress someone, whether it's on a date, an interview, business meeting, alumni, or family, this is the place to go. And IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER EATEN THAI FOOD BEFORE. You're sure to be in for a good experience. The portions are HUGE, especially if you get the curry pineapple fried rice (hugely popular). \n\nIt's a classy place. Seriously, this is the go-to place I recommend and make reservations to for when friends' have family coming over they need to show off to or visiting speakers/trainers for club. I would recommend dinner. Again, more extensive menu. And pretty much any of the desserts.\n\nBUT DON'T BE FOOLED, YOU CAN DRESS CASUAL. It's definitely more upscale, but the prices are pretty much the same and it's good for all occasions. So while you do have business men and women, advisers, counselors, and families coming in and out, you can definitely slum it as a college student and it's just fine. My club was the Bujinkan Yanagi Dojo, a martial arts club. We would sometimes take our speaker/trainer there after seminars, and almost everyone would come in training duds.Staff is cool like that and attentive.\n\nThey do reservations, but it tends to be more immediate. As they're more than a bit out of the way, walk-ins are easier with them. However, they're popular enough that if there is some big event going on, reserve early. They don't do 6 months ahead early, but one or two months ahead should suffice. They're REALLY good for large parties. Unlike Basil Thai, they have the room. Aforementioned seminar crowd had about 12 (walk-in) and I took a family of 7 (reservation) there another time. Both times, we fit comfortable in the back.",

      "text": "I will give Triple X four stars because it's an iconic member of the Purdue landscape, a diners & drive in feature and a place with special memories.  The building is special because if\nIt's location, styling and age.  It's noting special.  Actually a lot of the memorabilia that was on the walls is now gone.\n\nNon-breakfast items are interesting as many are named after famous Purdue alumni meal preferences.  I personally recommend the Duane Purvis - hamburger with peanut butter.  Sounds gross but it's delicious!!\n\nOn this occasion we went for breakfast.  My wife ordered the veggie omelet.  She was impressed with how many veggies were inside.  She said the hash browns were the best she has ever had.  She also ordered Triple X jam...a hand made jelly with a root beer taste...very unique!!\n\nI ordered the ham and egg sandwich.  This sandwich featured real ham...no pieces of Canadian ham.  The sandwich was okay...nothing really special.  I also ordered the biscuits and gravy.  The biscuits are purchased but still soft and tasty.  The gravy is a bit thin without a distinctive taste.  The gravy does have a decent amount of sausage - about some in every forkful.  I put a decent amount of pepper on it to jack it up more...it just doesn't have a distinctive taste.\n\nTriple X now takes credit cards. That is a positive change.  \n\nThey have made several covid changes.  They have plexiglass around the countertops.  QR code's are how you get your menu.  They installed outdoor tent seating and require two seats between cust Owens at the counter.\n\nOn the down side...they still require you to stand in line to pay inside the building.  There is no room to social distance here.  The cashier takes phone orders which backs up the customers trying to pay.  I was also disappointed that the waitress didn't wipe down the condiments and salt & pepper shakers after we were finished.",

Because of that they are now taking credit card!  Usually cash only. I had the Boilermaker Pete this time. A triple cheese burger with onions. The wrapper was so soaked in grease, you could see the burger through the paper. That's a really good drive in burger. Had fries and a root beer with it.   If they served fried with the burger I would have given them 5 stars, but since the burger cost $10 without, they are getting only 4. \n\nA solid 4 bellies on my 5 belly scale.",

Bill was a very reasonably inexpensive $44.14 before tip for a truckload of food at a sit down establishment that is an icon. With two adults, two teenagers, and a preteen, we could spend close to that at a fast food chain. Food was great, especially the omelet, and the service was fast. Would definitely come here again. As out-of-towners, we were also very pleased with the parking situation. Only complaint was that the bbq sandwich seemed slightly on the small side.",

      "text": "I found Triple XXX by signing up for an Indiana tourism email with a link for 20 Destination Restaurants in Indiana. Also, Guy Fieri has visited Triple XXX on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. There was plenty of intrigue.\n\nThe building is black and orange and the name very eye-catching if your mind is in the gutter. The name refers to the highest quality of root beer at what was once a thirst station found around the country in the early 20th century. Triple XXX is the last one standing and located very close to Purdue.\n\nI ordered something unusual for me...a root beer! But I felt like I had to order one from here and it didn't disappoint. I have hated root beer most of my life but it has grown on me with this being the best I have had.  It just seemed to have a more fresh flavor.  I also went with the root beer float thar contained real ice cream for a solid win.\n\nBesides root beer, Triple XXX is known for their burgers. Guy Fieri ate the Purvis which has peanut butter on it. That's not for me.  I went with Flash Gordon that had bacon, grilled onions, jalepenos, American cheese, jalepeno ketchup, and 4 sirloin patties!  The patties looked like McDonald's patties but they had a better quality of taste to them.  The menu states they put the meat in flour before cooking.  Curly fries were the perfect accompaniment. \n\nOne destination restaurant down in Indiana and more to go!",

      "text": "Having to update, not fun! I want to recommend TripleXXX to everyone as THE option for easy going filling in the area. However it isn't worthy of the TV hype. Yes, might be just me: I bet what annoys me brings in the customers. But the breakfasts? Cracker Barrel minus value, an average mess of over processed ingredients just like the college kids make. I have noticed the chili is fantastic. Root beer? It's good. Service? It'll do. The burgers and experience are what get me hot under the snooty Purdue alumni collar. I should have a better undergrad diner! Nearly $10 for a burger with a lil cache of fries? Cash only? No rewards program? Cramped noisy space? 5 Guys right up the hill giving me way more food for my $10 with more space, modern payment options, excellent rewards app, this cannot just be me. I tried an off menu burger with pineapple on it. Fat slice of Hawaiian goodness is magic on beef no matter what you haters say about it also working on pizza. Months later, I still can't believe it was canned pineapple. Watery, mushy, so sad for a restaurant that showed off itself on TV to make Guy cry. OK I know, All Hail Purdue and Boilernation but really, this is my little opinion and ya'll (obviously) are gonna run past me and love this place for all its backwards charm. Allow me a rant because I want a worthy campus burger joint! Well we have it folks: The Tap right up on top of the hill is literally on top of XXX in every way, fantastic atmosphere, wonderful selection of brews (sorry kids 21+), beautiful burgers, pizzas, it's all there just like I dreamed XXX would be. Also Teay's River, best burger and draft selection in the area, take the whole family there, plenty of room. I wonder how long Triple XXX can last like this? Cash, no rewards app, cramped interior, bathroom for 1 mouse, ingredients better served at the Golden M right south, and not the value a diner should be - all these first world problems up against Teays, The Tap, Bru Burger, D.T. Kirbys, Wolfies, Big Woods, AJ's, Town & Gown, Christos, Harry's, Dog n Suds, and even Wendys. Most of those offer all the goods: rewards program, pay with plastic, plenty of space in a modern open atmosphere, superb menu of tasty original foods, and value.",

I would be lying if I told you that wasn't the main reason I stopped in while I was in the area. \n\nOverall the service was really good - I did have to wait a long time for my food (everyone around me arrived after me and was served well before me) - but that is the only drawback in terms of service! The menu has many options, however, if you are a vegetarian like me there are few choices - either a grilled cheese or something off of the breakfast menu. I ordered the veggie omelette with potatoes and toast. It was good, and I would order it again. The burgers (one of the things they are known for!) sounded amazing and smelled so good - I would recommend these to any of my non-vegetarian friends! \n\nThe ambiance is very comfortable and the restaurant itself is very unique, but a diner feel that is hard to find these days.

My cheese wasn't even barely melted. The sandwich was fairly small. The fries were just okay. I felt like I could've just went to McDonald's next door for a similar burger and probably cheaper.

I haven't had a chance to try out many other Chinese food places in Lafayette/West Lafayette, except for Peppercorns Kitchen, so I don't have a lot to compare with locally. \n\nTheir service is prompt and only on one occasion did they get our order wrong. Portions are good sized and prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, most of their takeaway dishes come in plastic containers. Hope they'll make changes to that soon.\n\nFood is good. The reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because certain dishes have turned out differently to what I'm used to. For example, on two occasions the kung pao chicken had been deep fried. Traditionally (correct me if I'm wrong), kung pao chicken is not a deep fried dish. \nTheir vegetarian mapo tofu is really yum - I'd definitely recommend that. \n\nMy other major concern with their food is that they use a LOT of oil. I usually end up scooping out multiple tablespoons of oil before eating. Please, please cut back on how much oil you guys use. It's pretty nasty.",

Their eggplant Szechwan is amazing and the hot & sour soup was possibly the best I've ever had. Normally that kind of soup is mainly just spicy, but this was full of all kinds of flavor too. The garlic sauce is light, not the \"American Chinese\" brown sauce kind, so be prepared if you're expecting that; it's very different, though good! The food had a much more authentic Chinese flavor in my opinion.\n\nCons: They got our order wrong so we had to refund/reorder, but they fixed the second batch very quickly. The crab rangoon was ok; it's not as good as some. Probably won't order it again only because everything else was so good by comparison. They also sent no soy sauce, but that might be because I didn't request the driver to get any. \n\nIt's such good food that we would definitely order from there again; I know mistakes happen. Very happy to have tried them!",

It was almost perfect but some of the veggies were not thoroughly cooked so there was a bit of raw vegetable taste (mainly in the onion, I think they threw in the peppers and onions at the same time but onions take longer to cook).\n\nIt was a little pricy at $13, but that was reflected in the quality of the ingredients (Fresh vegetables and good quality pork).

      "text": "Taste, located in the old CT Market building, is a restaurant we've quickly become regulars at. It's a very spacious location that they've renovated, and it looks very modern and open inside now. \n\nThere are two options when it comes to Taste - hot pot or just regular food. We have yet to try hot pot, but I will update my review when we do. The regular menu is fantastic, however.\n\nWe've tried many dishes here, including a lot of the dumplings, mapo tofu, fried rice, various beef and chicken dishes, and more. I can definitely say my favorite is the beef with scallions; absolutely delicious. The beef is tender, and I love onions/scallions, so it's a homerun for me. The dishes come with rice upon request, and I definitely recommend it. Some of the dishes are definitely on the spicy side, so make sure to ask about that if it's a concern. \n\nService here can be a on the longer side at times, but for the most part, our food has arrived on time. Service staff is very friendly.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, but just be aware that they charge an 18% service charge at dinner, so make sure to note that. (Though if you tip regularly like myself, this shouldn't be a big deal, as it takes the place of the tip.)\n\nOverall, definitely give it a try!",

      "text": "This used to be the old CT Market, which used to have a restaurant quietly tucked in the back, but I'm guessing they didn't want to compete with the New World Market right across the street, so there's an entire restaurant here instead now.\n\nWent here with a friend who doesn't speak Chinese and we got the Peking Duck meal set, Szechuan Wontons, and Snow Pea Leaves. The Peking Duck meal set costs around $40 and comes with either a soup option or a stir-fried option for the excess meat of the duck that doesn't go into the actual Peking Duck. I would say this is among the best Peking Duck I've had in the Midwest, including the likes of Chicago's Lao Sze Chuan, and easily the best in the Lafayette area (much better than the nearby Peppercorn Kitchen and Szechuan Garden). The presentation is wonderful, the meat is rich but thin, and the skin is nice and crispy. The garnishes and sauce are flavorful without being too strong. We got the soup option, which was also nice and hearty, but not quite as spectacular as the main event. The Szechuan Wontons were also some of the best dumplings I've had in a while, with a subtle sweet and peppercorn flavor; my friend was also especially impressed with the dumplings. \n\nThere are two potential downsides that I can see someone experiencing here. First, the items are pricey, especially after the mandatory 18% service charge. I think the food quality was very \"authentic\" and worth the price for the dishes that we ordered and I had the fortune of being able to communicate with the staff in their native language. Unlike a lot of places with foreign staff, they were pretty cheerful and polite and provided decent service. However, this also brings me to my second potential concern. They clearly preferred to converse in their native language, which was somewhat exclusive to my non-speaking friend, so I'm not sure what experience an entire group of non-speakers would have.",

We asked our server about this but she said it's the same thing. I still don't quite believe that, but even if it is true, why does the same dish appear on the menu more than once? Also, the dish we ordered was not supposed to be spicy, but what we got was covered in red and green chillis.\n\nWe were also served by 3 different people who all had to look at the check on our table multiple times to figure out what part of our order was still missing. Despite that,  all three dishes we ordered were served separately, the rice to go with them only came after we reminded them about that and the Appetizer arrived dead last, when we were already pretty much done with the mains.\n\nI usually don't mind patchy service all that much, because after all if I'm not happy with it I can always give a slightly lower tip than usual. But here, an 18% tip is automatically included in the bill. I hate that because it leads to terrible service.\n\nThe place itself is very posh but there was very loud pop music in the background, which was a bit strange.\n\nThe menu is very extensive but it doesn't really describe the dishes, it contains items like \"Beef - 12.95\". \n\nAll of this is a shame because the food itself was not bad.",

We ordered the chips and queso and fettucini alfredo with chicken. The queso was delicious! The queso had a perfect blend of all the right flavors. There was even a hint of bacon in the queso. I thoroughly enjoyed the chips and dip. The dinner rolls were super fluffy, buttery, and moist. The pasta was delicious but very greasy. The greasiness of the pasta was pretty off putting. Also, we waited a really long time to get our food despite how few people were in the restaurant. Overall, the food was great and I highly recommend.",

We both ordered drinks to start; I ordered the blueberry lavender mojito. It ended up being too strong and I asked our waiter to add a splash of lemonade, which made it so much better! We then ordered the chips and queso appetizers share and WOW! It was AMAZING!!!! The chips are homemade and came out so hot and fresh. I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone who dines here. My friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo pasta and I ordered the asian chicken lettuce cups. We both liked our food! I kind of expected my lettuce cups to be assembled already, but it came as a spread that I assembled myself. This was fine as well, just a little messy to eat! The peanut sauce that comes with it is the perfect flavor for this dish! The only problem overall was the ceiling slowly dripping on my friend throughout our meal... We think this was because of how hot and humid it was outside. Otherwise, it was a great experience! Our waiter was very kind and attentive!",

The menu has a lot of good options for a lot of different types of eaters. \n\nWe got the shrimp and feta pasta, risotto, salmon, and truffle Mac & cheese. They all came with salads, which came with a great mango chardonnay dressing. We were served complimentary bread & butter before our meal. The shrimp & feta pasta was my favorite, it was a great twist to the different cheesy pasta options, and it had little tender chunks of pork belly in it as well! The risotto was the most disappointing, but we still ate most of it. Truffle Mac and cheese came with lots of lobster, which was pretty delicious! The salmon was flaky in a good way, and it came with crispy potato medallions in a pool of guacamole. \n\nOverall? A great restaurant to enjoy good food with good company.",

      "text": "I really enjoyed the Pecan Chicken Rollup.  Not too filling for a lunch time meal and the taste was excellent.  The chicken tenders were breaded in crushed pecans, deep fried, and then wrapped in tortillas with a Honey-lime sauce, tomato, & lettuce for a great combo taste of sweet & savory with a bit of crunch.  \n\nI chose fries to go with the wraps and they were a bit disappointing.  There were plenty of the shoestring variety, but they were cool and chewy like you get when they sit out under a heat lamp.  I don't know for sure, just that they reminded me of those disappointing ones.  \n\nThe place has a really nice ambiance and I was served promptly, but it was a little weird sitting at the bar for lunch and then the bartender disappeared for the entirety of my meal.  My service was picked up by a waiter, but it felt really odd being the only one seated there and nobody on the other side of the counter.  Made it seem like I wasn't getting noticed since my waiter was only in the bar area sparingly.  Still, he did a good job of getting the food out and bringing my check.  Just would have been nice to have him check on whether I liked my food or needed a refill on my water before I was finished.\n\nBut the entree was excellent, so I will let that skew my rating higher than I might have otherwise given.\n\nReview #1534",

The interior reminds me of a classy, old school dinner-date restaurant that really makes for a nice fancy-ish ambiance. The server I had was very attentive with drink refills, orders, and check ups. The food was amazing too! I had the shrimp risotto that a very unique creole style with pork belly and mushroom flavors folded into the creamy risotto and shrimp. My date had the shrimp fettuccini which she also really enjoyed. The price per person is about 30-35 with drinks which is on par with the quality of the service and food. Certainly will be coming back in the future!",

And Red Seven was as close as a crosswalk.\n\nTall smokey glass outside windows, wooden paneled, sectioned off booths to one side. Shiney-glassed mirrored bar back with hightop fours behind the bar seating. At 8P in a Big 10 town, the joint is... empty! Ah, it is spring break. We chose a Hightop and service was prompt. How could it be anything but.\n\nSignature cocktails Gin and Sin Martini, Cool as a Cucumber chiller and a Grayson Pinot Noir, all at $8 per, start the conversation. A southwestern grilled chicken salad $10, chorizo stuffed empanadas $8 and asian veggie egg rolls $8, round out the shareable evening nosh. Before you can say March Madness, plates of fresh prepared groceries are delivered to the tall table. Delicious satisfaction followed...along with a repeat of the conversation starter.\n\nIn my usual close, would we return? Well with a nod to 1960 and Mr Elmer Bernstein one might say this was the Theme to the Pretty Darn Good Red Seven.... know what i mean?",

A strong cultured dining experience and huge menu combined with the very friendly service makes this a go to spot in the county for unique and super tasty food. We had a small sampling of the falafel and shawarma which was tons of food! We went for a takeout thinking it would not have a lot of space for distancing but wish we would have dined in upon noticing how much room is here. Our food was perfectly flavored and went down just like the ideal classic Mediterranean fare of other places I really enjoy like Kebab-G in Peoria, IL. My parents enjoyed some leftovers, quite sure I convinced them without having to say anything!",

Service was super nice and helped us ordering because we had multiple questions. I ordered a sautee ghallaba that was delicious. It came with 2 sides. The lentil soup was my favorite. Also, it was basmati rice that we all know is quite good. My husband had the falafel sandwich and he couldn't finish it because it was pretty big. \nThe portions were very generous so we had enough to take home. Do try their Baklava.

      "text": "So confused by the glowing reviews on this place. This was our second time eating there. This time takeout, last time pre-pandemic dine in. Both times we felt the food was lacking. \n\nThe chicken shawarma sandwich was extremely dry and no noticeable garlic flavor. The cucumber salad is more like yogurt with a garnish of cucumber. The spinach pies looked amazing, but were greasy and the cheese to spinach ratio was way off. Needed more cheese for sure. \n\nHummus was fine. Be warned, there is a choice of classic or spicy hummus. The CLASSIC comes covered in jalapeños. So ask to skip them if you have an aversion to spice. \n\nThe sautéed mushrooms was the best dish we had. Nice mix of spices and very flavorful. But in two visits, that's the only thing we'd order again. \n\nWas also disappointed in the level of customer service. When I called to place the order, the person just answered the phone w hello. I had to ask if this was Almadina. Then, at pickup, two server/hostess front of house staff not wearing masks. One was talking to three guests who were leaving, and two of the three guests were not wearing masks. One of the guests had to call the hostess's attention to my presence. When she turned around and saw me, she put a mask on. They must have been friends/family. But you expect a place to follow the signs it has posted on its own doors. And if that's how things are handled front of house, what is happening in the kitchen?",

I realized, even in my burned out state, how absolutely great this restaurant is.\n\nWe ordered the Shawarma plate for two. Oh my lord it could have fed four. And every single piece of meat on that plate is perfectly juicy and tender. The hummus that we ordered with it was smooth and tasty. I loved this meal. \n\nMy son went with the chicken sandwich. I had a bite and was blown away by the flavor of that one. If you are into sandwiches, I would go with this one.\n\nThey accidentally brought us fries instead of rice. This was quickly remedied but I'm so glad they made the mistake. I tried the fries and they are awesome! I mean, I like rice with the Shawarma plate, but if you're into fries, I'd give it a go. \n\nThis has to be one of the top restaurants in Lafayette. If you're driving through like we were, definitely make the stop. If you live nearby, plan to visit weekly. It is that good. One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever been to. This one is an absolute gem.",

      "text": "My wife and I stopped here on the way home from an out-of-state trip. We decided to grab a quick bite and Mediterranean sounded perfect. This The building has tons of room, though when we arrived it was entirely empty, due to the lockdown, which has only started to get more lax.\n\nWe sat and looked over the menu, ordered a sample platter of hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouli, which were brought out shortly with some complementary fresh rolls and a creamy garlic sauce. The rolls were so warm and so fresh, and with the garlic sauce, were truly remarkable. Simple ingredients, but done so well. It was exquisite.\n\nThe hummus was the creamiest hummus I've ever eaten, truly delivious, as was the baba ganoush. I'm not much of a fan of tabouli, more something for my wife, but it wasn't bad either. We ordered our entrees, but I started to think I might not be hungry enough to eat much, once I finished with the amazing bread and dips we already had.\n\nI was already thinking \"five-star for sure\" after the appetizer and garlic sauce, as our entrees were brought out. Unfortunately, that's where the quality diverged.\n\nI ordered a lamb shawarma wrap that sounded right up my alley, with lettuca, tomato, onions, and a tahini sauce that made my mouth water. Once I took my first bite, though, the magic was gone. The tahini was bland; not the usual bursting-with-flavor-sauce I was expecting. The portion I tried only had veggies, which were fine, but just a little plain without the strength of the sauce.\n\nI took a bite with lamb this time, hoping it would save the wrap, but it made it worse. The lamb chunks were ENORMOUS. In a wrap, where I won't be using a fork, they should surely be cut into bite-size pieces, but they were at least two or three times that. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but when I attempted to cut them with my teeth, as one would do with a wrap, the meat was SO chewy. I ended up making a mess, having to drag the chunk of meat out of the wrap and pull it apart with my teeth and hands just so I could get a piece small enough to manage.\n\nThe wrap was a disappointment, probably a 2-star, maybe even 1, because the lamb was also rather unseasoned. The appetizer and complementary garlic sauce/bread was 5-star, though, and I believe it's possible some other entrees here are better than what I had, but if the lamb is any indication of meat in other dishes, I'd be concerned.\n\nPortions were decent for the price, but certainly not my favorite meal I've ever had.",

      "text": "Al Madina Restaurant is an amazing place for a couple to have a quiet dinner or a large group to hold a big dinner. With ample seating enough to fit many, you can find a corner that best suites your liking. The outside of the building has a fresh coat of paint which does not in any means give way to the beautiful middle eastern vibe on the inside. The inside of the restaurant is lightly decorated with decorative rugs, pictures from the Middle East, mosaic sconces, and beautiful mosaic lighting as well. The ambiance on the inside is quite and pretty. It is the new hidden gem on the block! \n\nAt a first glance of the menu, it seems a bit much, there are many options to choose from, and there are lots of different styles of kebabs. So what does one get? Well, my wife and I tried their \"Shish Combo for 2\" in the combo and party trays section of the menu. This was recommended by one of the waiters. Let me tell you, this will NOT disappoint! It was such good tasting food, with big portion sizes for such a good price! At just $30, this tray had 7 pieces of kebab, we chose our two sides of rice and hummus, and we were brought complimentary bread with garlic butter. \n\nMoving from New Jersey/ New York to Lafayette Indiana, I had to be the judge of this restaurant. I went in expecting the food to not be as good as back from the east coast, BUT the food blew my mind. I was VERY impressed with the \"juicyness\" of the chicken, the tenderness of the meat, and the overall taste of the entire meal. From the complimentary bread, to a flavorful plate of whipped hummus, straight to the main entree, the food was delicious. You were able to tell that the bread, hummus, kebabs, and everything was made FRESH to order. I am one who always finishes my meals at a restaurant, but I had to request a box to go for some leftovers. \n\nThe food was amazing, and what about the staff you ask?  The staff is very friendly, and humbled. The waiters that waited on us were actually part owners of the restaurant. The chef had a bit of down time and stopped by our table to see how everything was as well. You definitely receive the vibe of open arms and welcome from the team of people who run this restaurant. \n\nNow, this review would not be complete without me pointing out some of the flaws. The first thing I would want to see is a bit more friendly entrance on the exterior of the building. Maybe some flower pots, or some more color. The inside of the place is beautiful, and some of that culture needs to be brought to the outside as well. Secondly, I wish the music was more in the field of \"middle eastern\" there was casual American songs playing in the speakers, but it just did not fit. Maybe a little middle easter music would complete the restaurant. Other than that, no complaints on the food or the service. \n\nI encourage everyone to go with a friend or your significant other and definitely, definitely try out the \"shish combo for two!\"\n\n*** This review was not sponsored by the restaurant, and I have no affiliations with any member of this restaurant***",

I had the beef pho, and it was delicious! They have some other options on the menu, but most of the entrees have some sort of noodle in it. If you dig noodles, this is definitely the place for you!\n\nPros\n- The name says it all. They've got ramen, pho, mei fun, udon, lo mein and more!\n- Just order at the counter, and they bring it out to your table.\n- Reasonable prices - $8.99 for a big bowl o' pho!\n- Delivery and takeout available\n- Quiet and intimate, great for a date or a place to catch up with a friend.\n- Quick and friendly service\n- FREE WATER!!!!!! :D\n\nCons\n- Not good for groups because it's a pretty small place.\n- There aren't servers, just one lady at the register who brings your food.\n- Parking is basically non-existent. We parked in the Chauncey Mall parking lot and walked over.",

It's located where Maru Sushi was before it moved across the street, and though the look may have completely changed, Noodles & I managed to keep the initiate, tucked away, almost cafe-like vibe. It's now a lot lighter and has a clean aesthetic to it.\n\nSolid Asian noodle place with Japanese, Chinese (Cantonese, Beijing Sichuan), Taiwanese, Korean, Thai, and Singapore flavors. A+++ on variety! Completely different from Noodle and Company, and I feel like the flavor profiles are so different that there's no competition (there is). Service was quick, place has a very clean feel to it. Excellent for date night, friends night out, the aftermath of breakfast club, and late night study sessions. Especially because it's just around the corner from study spots like Vienna and Greyhouse. REALLY good for winter nights or when you're getting a quick, sit-down lunch between classes or work (and Maru Sushi is too full). Won't lie, this isn't the best place for vegetarians or vegans. Most of the dishes have some sort of meat. There are definitely more options if you're a pescetarian, as there's a good number of seafood options. However, it's first rate from anyone lactose-intolerant or allergic to milk.\n\nMy first time, I came here with my club's treasurer for a late dinner on Monday (Maru Sushi was closed). It was definitely steered more towards an Asian crowd. While I excited at all the options like the fried udon, roast duck noodle, and the Dan Dan noodles, my friend (I'd only introduced him to Panda Express, Yummy Time, Maru Sushi, and Basil Thai by that point) was very confused. I ended up ordering the Singapore Mee Fu and he got the Braised Beef Noodle. I was REALLY happy with my Singapore Mee Fun, as it had been the year after I'd lived and worked for a couple of months in Singapore. After my time there, I missed the unique flavors from there and this made me really happy. However, my friend was really confused because Taiwanese Braised Beef Noodle soup apparently doesn't taste anything like American beef noodle soup. The way the beef was cooked confused him, the noodles confused him, and he kept asking why they put a whole egg in it. Overall though, he didn't hate. So just heads up for if you or a friend you want to bring are not as familiar with Asian cuisine. I encourage anyone to visit if they have time!",

      "text": "I feel like the name of this place might throw people off (especially since it is across from Noodles & Company). There's definitely a lot of flavor in these dishes in respect to that OTHER noodle place. For my first time visit I got the Vietnamese Pho with beef. There's a handful of pho options, but you gotta go with the Vietnamese one right. My bowl of pho was a large, expected size, but very easy to consume for a lunch. It came out quickly, piping hot. It was a little on the salty side, but all in all, that's some good lunchtime pho. PHO-NOMENAL!\n\nMy friend got the pad thai, and he was also pleased with his meal. I will be coming back to try other dishes for sure. Places like this need the business. Plus it's got a nice sit-down restaurant feel, but you just order and pay up front and then leave when you're done. That's bonus convenience worth expressing.\n\nNoodle & I?

I ordered the 1 for the spice level and my boyfriend ordered 2. \n\nIt took over 40 minutes for us to get our food. The fried chicken lacked breading.  It was flavorful, but definitely not what we were expecting.  It really tasted like seasoned chicken, not fried chicken. When the ramen came out, we were disappointed.  It looked like one had more hot sauce/oil in than the other so my boyfriend and I switched, assuming his was the one with more sauce/oil.  The server failed to mention which was which. She seemed confused. \n\nThe pork was rubbery - I wish that it was grilled a little more.  The broth was okay, a little bland.  I noticed other tables got different seasonings to add, but we were only given pepper. \n\nOverall, I don't think i'll be returning.  While, it's closer to campus, I do favor the other ramen restaurant more.",

      "text": "A much cuter place than I was expecting with terrific ramen and a homemade broth with extremely rich depth of flavor. I was impressed by this place since it is quite close to Purdue University's campus but it doesn't feel like a cheap college restaurant. There's a substantial amount of seating, and the place was fairly busy on a Friday night when my friend and I went, but we were seated instantly. \n\nThey have eight ramen options, but all are pork-based and the only meat option is pork belly. I don't normally like pork belly, but it was homemade here and it was fantastic! Of the eight ramen options, four are not-spicy, and the other four are the same as the first four, just with the option of 3 levels of spicy. Both my friend and I went with the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen, level 2 spicy. The ramen was served with noodles, fish cakes, a hard-boiled egg, pork belly, seaweed, scallions, and mushrooms with ramen pepper at the table. It seemed like the spicy factor came from the amount of chili oil they added to the ramen, which is a bit like a ripoff since the spicy ramen costs a dollar more than the regular ramen for just a bit of spicy oil ($11 for regular, $12 for spicy). While it didn't feel worth the extra dollar, I think the spicy factor was a great addition to the meal. \n\nPlease note that they don't have a license for alcohol yet, so your options are water, soda, and tea. They also have a list of appetizers/meals like edamame, tempura veggies, and chicken katsu on their menu. Overall, a great place to warm up and eat some great ramen!",

      "text": "I was excited when I found out there was a new Ramen place, especially one near campus. The first time I went there on a Sunday evening, they told me there was a 40 minute wait. I wasn't going to wait that long, so I came back on a very late evening on a weekday, around 8 ish. It was empty, but yet I had the slowest service ever. There was only one person working at the cashier and also serving everyone in the restaurant....so I was ignored for the longest time because she was so occupied at the cashier.\n\n20 minutes later, got the food and oh dear....\n\nThe shio ramen was so bland. The broth was almost tasteless and there was only one very thin slice of meat....it was a really sad experience. It's like they watered down the broth until it's completely tasteless.\n\nIf you get the spicy one for a dollar extra, they dump some chilli oil in it and call it spicy...you can literally see the pool of oil on the top of the broth (also only on one side of the bowl)\n\nWe also tried the \"fried\" chicken....it doesn't even have any breading on it...and the spicy version is just drenched in oil. Nowhere close to what a proper karaage should be like...\n\nOverall, absolutely not worth the money for the quality of food and be prepared to wait forever to get your food.",

      "text": "Lovely little mom and pop Ramen shop. Atmosphere and decor are very charming, the kitchen is open which is fun to watch and there's other dishes to choose if you don't want Ramen. The Ramen is good, but limited in variety. There's another Ramen shop downtown which I think I like better for noodles, but where Denju really gets me is their Curry Katsu and their rice bowls. Their curry is so good, and really hits the spot on a cooler day. Rice bowls are very hearty and filling with a good spread of options. The Chicken Karaage is delicious too. The chunks of chicken are very juicy and don't get dried out and bland when fried, and the fry coating is very tasty (spritz some of the lemon juice from the lemon garnish). They claim to make their broths from scratch, which I can believe as there's a little variance from the bowls I've had at different times. Which I kind of like, makes it feel less process and manufactured. \n\nI've seen a few reviews about service, which I think are pretty unfair. Every time I've been, it's been the same staff. And I'm just speculating, but it looks like a family run place, with 1 server. Looks like mom and pop in the kitchen and the daughter running front of house. Could be way off base, but I've never had a disgustingly long wait (typically in and out in 40min), and they're beyond nice. They're all very sweet and smile brightly when you leave and say thank you, even when it's busy. Something to be said about a staff that treats you as a human instead of a dollar sign.\n\nIf you want an authentically fast Ramen shop, try Yata across the river. If you want a nice place to have a conversation, enjoy the atmosphere, and have some warm comfort food that was lovingly handmade, give this place a shot.",

I really liked their take on karaage (fried chicken) without the breading. The flavor was great and the mayo dipping sauce was quite refreshing. Ryland our server was really sweet as well! My one stipulation is the spiciness comes only from chili oil which was disappointing. Overall had a great visit and will be back!",

The Tap offers outdoor seating, generous and well thought out inside, a meager yet smart menu, local brews, and a solid friendly staff. Be prepared, there are 70 on tap drips! Easy to get confused! Needs a better way to organized, hopefully there's easier ways to figure out what to order online soon! Will definitely be back and try more things, everyone in our group enjoyed their meals except some had minor niggles more for their own tastes I thought than actual issues. The Black & Blue burger is amazing. Tatter tots appetizer rocks socks. An easy option for adult campus dining, glad to see the first floor of Rise put to good use.",

It's like a nice place for upperclassmen at Purdue to gather while still having a great place to bring your parents when they come to visit.\n\nI have had a different variety of their menu since they've opened and I've loved every item, even the salads (which sometimes aren't the best at other grill and burger places). You really need to try the truffle parmesan dip for your fries as it's the best dipping sauce I've had.\n\nThe customer service is great and they always have a beer to recommend when you are trying to figure out what to try. It's even better that they have free sample sizes so you aren't stuck with a whole beer that you don't enjoy! The only problem I've run into here is the music is excessively loud. It's hard to hear your friends or family that are sitting right across from you.",

The friendly customer service dude told me I could come in to pay (which sort of surprised me, because I thought businesses were only doing curbside right now). I explained to him that I am OLD af, so he said he would bring it out to the car. \n\nTen minutes later, I pulled up, showed him my ID, signed the CC receipt and he loaded the beer into my car. I wasn't thrilled about having to sign the CC receipt, sort of wish they would try to figure out a way to not make people sign during this virus thing. He told me they had been cleaning the pens between each transaction though.\n\nThe beer (Bionic Dragon Blood Orange) was delicious and super fresh. Looking forward to the pandemic fading away and enjoying beers (and food) at the Tap again soon. In the meantime, curbside is the way to go.",

      "text": "The Tap menu features something so useful, so simple, and so utilitarian that I simply can't believe that this is the first time that I've come across it. With two pages of beers brewed in-house, determining what to order could prove confusing if you had to go off of names and descriptions alone. Obviously, the types of brews are listed as well, which helps, but there is also a small Cartesian graph with Sweet/Bitter on the X axis and Dark/Light on the Y with the type of beer plotted. This is GENIUS! \nBetween the striking number of quality-sounding beers listed and my appreciation for their menu ingenuity, I'm already feeling very favorable toward The Tap. \n\nI mentioned the large selection of beers, both their own and many others on tap as well as some 1700 in bottles or cans. There are also ciders and a few other brews, but there is limited wine and no liquor, so don't come in looking for cocktails. You'll be able to find something that you'll enjoy if you even marginally like beer.\n\nOr good food. I didn't mention the food yet, which is excellent! Appetizers, entrees, desserts? Got it all and everything has great flavor!\n\nService was also amazing! Our server was a former bartender who knew the answer to everything we asked as well as being quick and friendly. \n\nThe space is large, with lots of pub tables, booths in the back and a long, winding bar that sits below a small stage for live acts that looks over the two rooms. TVs are present, but not overwhelming, thankfully. Rather, the many paintings of sports or the foot traffic outside seen through the two walls of windows distract the eye more than anything. \n\nIf you enjoy beer and good food, I highly recommend The Tap!",

      "text": "I cannot get enough of this restaurant. From the outside, it's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall kind of place on the corner of Main and 6th downtown, but hold your judgment and be prepared to be wowed. They've opened during the past year when between-table barriers became standard. So I don't know if they were planning originally to make the section dividers that they've ended up with or if they were a response to Covid, but either way, they're tasteful and artsy. In fact, the entire place has an artistic flair that combines original Japanese culture with a modern Japanese pop approach to style. From the low stools (which are great and much more comfy than they look), to the artwork on the walls, to even the decor and design of the bathrooms, someone has put a lot of thought into the overall vibe and it shows. A fantastic atmosphere.\n\nNow for the best part...the food. My top recommendations are:\n1. I canNOT get enough of they're spicy miso ramen. If you're not a fan of heat, just get the regular miso ramen. It has all of the flavor without the kick. The meat is my favorite part, but the eggs are a close second. I have no idea how they pack this much taste into one bowl. It's unreal.\n2. The gyoza. It's like a chicken-pork pot sticker. VERY delicious and a fantastic appetizer!\n3. The mochi ice cream. It's like ice cream with a soft chewy outside. Hard to describe, easy to eat. I've had the strawberry, and it's worth it.\n\nOverall, a very solid lunch or dinner location. It's informal enough to meet here for a lunch with a friend but would be just as well suited to a Friday night date spot!",

Yatagarasu has Ramen that can compete with the big cities.\n\nRamen 5/5 -  Black Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen. The broth were excellent with the intense garlic kick infused into the deep, creamy and smoky flavors from the long hours of extracting it from the bones. \n\nInterior 5/5 - Love the chic brick and timber interior, very rustic and raw feel.\n\nStaff 5/5 - Quick efficient service with a smile. \n\nPrice 4/5 - A little dear for the Ramen, but the lunch meal with a drink and side dish for $15 redeems it a little.\n\nParking 5/5 - plenty of free parkings outside.

      "text": "I cannot explain to you how good this place is, but I'll try. I just moved here a couple months ago from Virginia and though I'm from the Midwest originally, three years in the south has made me weak to these winters again. Cold Novembers mean solid ramen is a must and Yatagarasu did NOT disappoint.\n\nMy brother and I had the Fried Calamari and Chicken Karaage (not pictured because we got too excited). The seasoning in the breading was impeccable and the sauce for the karaage had such a nice zest to it. The crunch was so solid that it tasted good even to the ears.\n\nWe both got the chicken ramen as our main bowl. My brother asked for \"some tofu\" but our server, Bailey, heard \"sub tofu\" (my brother's mistake, not Bailey's). Bailey was quick to get the original helping of chicken for the ramen and was so sincere about the miscommunication even though it totally wasn't his fault!\nI opted to get a bunch of extras because I'm a man who needs spice, and the chili oil and paste did not disappoint. The broth mixed with the chili was unbelievable. I felt so warm you'd think it was summer. Excellent flavor in the veggies, noodles had the perfect chew, and the chicken was so tender. If it isn't obvious to you yet, this was the best ramen I've ever had. (My brother, though Yelp-less, also agrees.)\n\nWe thought we were done, but the allure of strawberry mochi was too much to resist, so we caved. I didn't expect to enjoy such a cold treat in November but after all of the savory flavors in the ramen, the chilled sweetness was extremely refreshing. 15/10 mochi. Might even have to go back tomorrow for it.\n\nBailey, if you're reading this, you're the man. Also, to all the kitchen staff at Yatagarasu, thank you. Seriously. This meal was a gift.",

I first started to really get into ramen this summer while I was living in Dallas, Texas and ramen places were a dime a dozen. Lafayette, however, doesn't have as many options. Luckily, Yatagarasu is a solid choice. \n\nMy go-to order is the miso ramen. Simple, but delicious. It's savory and hearty while not overbearing. The pork is tender and moist, and I just wish there was more of it. I love the inclusion of a soft boiled egg. It adds to the depth of flavor. \n\nThe other stand-outs here are the small plates. We usually order 2-3 of them as appetizers. The star, for me, are the crispy Brussels sprouts. They're, as the name implies, crispy, with a nice sprinkling of salt and other seasoning. \n\nPrices are pretty decent here. Ramen runs around $13, but it's a generous serving. \n\nService is good, and there have only been a couple occasions where the food seemed to take a while. \n\nOverall, if you're a ramen fan, and you're in the Purdue/Lafayette area, I have no problems recommending this location.",

My buddy and I enjoyed the chicken strips and their original totchos - nachos but using tater tots instead of fries, a supreme idea! Major props for thinking outside the box and looking for a quality sour . I love a good sour and have a difficult time finding good ones anywhere. The Mad Dog apricot sour on tap was too good for words. The only issue we had was quite unique being a random locally produced video shown on three of the TV screens so we could not avoid it period it was extremely violent and brutally bloody, no ideal for keeping the appetite or making for an enjoyable dining experience. Both of us were rather distracted and put off our food by the horror. I personally am not a sports fan but I have never wished so much to see sports on the TVs! Hopefully when I come back on Fridays for the poutine it will be a more usual bar time which is exactly what this place should be and easily can be.",

      "text": "Came here on 11/18 in the late evening with my father, who has a service dog (vest, license, tag, the whole nine yards). As he was walking to a table, an employee (red shirt white dude) who was obviously intoxicated walked up from behind, put his arm around him, and asked why he needed a service dog. We informed him it was not legal to ask this question, asked him to maintain social distancing, and walked away to a table. About 3 minutes later, a blonde female employee (not visibly drunk) and a man claiming to be the manager who was incredibly drunk came up (again not social distancing) and asked again why my father needed a service dog. Again, we informed them it was illegal to ask. The manager said it can't be illegal because he likes dogs and would not stop asking. After some back and forth, including both employees attempting to pet and interact with my fathers service dog, they moved on. There was apparently a drag show trivia night, during which dancers were not social distancing and repeatedly danced up to our table dispute us asking her not to. After the third time, when the dancer approached the service dog, my father left the building and we stayed to pay our tab for the three beers we were unable to drink. A fight (verbal, but escalated because of alcohol) broke out between a table of 20 something drunk women who did not like service animals and a table of kind middle aged onlookers telling them to knock it off. We flagged down three employees, including the manager, and asked for our bill. The manager, who was so drunk he was not able to make eye contact, informed us he could not hear us and asked to follow us outside. Outside, he demanded to know why my father needed a service dog. We informed him it was illegal to ask and said we would like to pay our bill and leave. He again said that it was okay because he likes dogs, demanded to know what my father's disability is, all the while yelling and invading our (two women) personal space. We asked him to please back away and to calm down, and in reply he moved closer and again demanded to know my fathers disabilities. Feeling threatened and not being permitted to pay our tab despite pleading to, we walked away. Very disappointed in the staff and general attitudes. I love(d) this establishment and was a pre-Covid regular, but will no longer be returning. I recommend you do the same.",

This dive is the place to be. \n\nAside from having all the beers and spirits you could want, the food is out of this world. I'm talking Mexican and TexMex food that would have you think you're miles away from the border. \n\nPork Rinds so fresh and crispy, you'll wonder how you even ate the stuff in a bag. \n\nPoutine flavors so unique and flavorful, you'll be stalking the Dive's Facebook page to see what the next poutine combo will be. \n\nBrunch so bomb, you'll wake up on a Sunday to mosey in over to nosh on some Chilaquiles while sipping a delightful Bloody Mary. \n\nRun, don't walk, and get yourself the meal you deserve at Sixth Street Dive today! \n\nPRO TIP: if you like spicy, you want to try the house sauce ON EVERYTHING!",

We also tried out their chicken burrito.\n\nNow, the burrito was very disappointing. Just bland, and all the chicken seemed to have ended up on one side of the burrito. Will not be getting this again.\n\nHowever, the wings were divine. In fact, a week later we went back to get more. The sauce has a unique taste (and you can get extra on the side). Very juicy. $12 is a little hefty for an appetizer but there's a good portion of wings and it can easily be shared between two. \n\nTry the wings :)",

I had never had it before so I was looking forward to trying it. We got seated as soon as we walked in. We got the Beignets and asked for all 3 sauces so I could try it since it was my first time. Apparently her daughter really likes the beignets, so they ordered an extra order to go for her to share with her mom. Then for my meal, I got the Chilaquiles. The staff were friendly. It wasn't very busy while we were there. The food was okay. I'm glad I experienced it since my friend and her daughter like their food, but I would probably want to go somewhere else next time I visit and we go out to eat.",

      "text": "I'll begin by saying that my wife and I argued over this review when I told her that I was hardly impressed after leaving here. Sure, the food was OK, but getting it (and drinks) was like an act of Congress. If I had my way, this place would barely get two stars. But, my wife made some points that were important for her, and she's also a tough customer. So here it goes...\n\nThere's a certain irony about this place naming and patterning itself after a Texas landmark -- the lack of service here.  Texas' motto is 'friendship,' and the word 'friendly' is derived from the same word (friend).  Service here on our visit was anything but friendly. In fact, our server barely came around ... and when she did, she quickly darted to the adjacent table (who had questions about a beer) in the middle of my father giving his order. It got to the point that the manager had to step in and take care of our table. Back to that in a minute...\n\nThis place is definitely divey, but not in a Sixth Street (Austin) type of way.  If you've been to Sixth Street, you know that the divey places are just that. But this place is more 'Disney' divey. No biggie. \n\nThe food here is actually pretty good. The salsa was surprisingly Texas, as was the queso.  Though fried pork loin (the reason I came here) is hardly a Texas thing (we're a fried beef state), it was good ... served hot and fresh. But if you're looking for sweet tea -- also a Texas staple -- it ain't happening here. And if you get the same waitress we had the misfortune of having, she'll let you know that in a curt tone -- as if she's heard the question a thousand times and is tired of answering it.    \n\nWant any salad dressing here other than ranch or bleu cheese? Forget it. The manager himself told us \"We used to have other dressings but they didn't sell.\" So apparently, a couple of bucks worth of Italian or Thousand Island is too much for these folks.\n\nShould you come here at least once? Perhaps. But don't expect good service ... even if you're a student who's looking to get his drunk on. That said, I'm willing to bet that there are other superior joints in West Lafayette, for food, drink and good times.  And the whole Texas thing here? Don't buy it. We're better than that.",

Parking could be better, but luckily we found a spot around the corner. \n\nThe menu looks pretty great I definitely want to come back and try more things because I couldn't decide what to get! Ultimately, I went with the fish n chips and my boyfriend got the fried chicken sandwich with tater tots. Both were delicious! I loved their homemade tarter sauce and their fries were better than average in my opinion! \n\nThe only thing I had a problem with was the fact that my water tasted kind of sweet like fruit punch. I don't think my mason jar was fully clean. \n\nOther than that, I had a great time here! I like that it's 21+ and maybe I'll have a drink next time too.",

First the good - the beers on tap are exceptional. The \"totchos\" were a creative touch (think nachos, but with tater tots), and the wings were great (tasty, but advertised as \"really hot\", and actually quite mild). On the negative side, we ordered blackened chicken 'n chips, and got breaded instead. They were gracious about putting in another order for what we ordered immediately, and left the breaded chicken strips \"to snack on\" while they redid the order. Both were very tasty.\n\nWe didn't expect, and didn't appreciate, the abundance of naked women on the TV screens. The big bearded guy at the sound table in the fishnet stockings and a skirt was also kinda hard to ignore. The entertainment hadn't started when we left, so he may have been quite entertaining. But all around, the whole experience didn't make for a very relaxing, enjoyable evening (for us, at least), and we'll think twice about coming next time.",

      "text": "Went out for live music last night and decided to check it out here.   We used to come here all the time for live music at Clubhouse/Squirrel Cage. \n\nI can honestly say I can't remember the last time I was here on a Saturday night, 9pm-ish. \n\nThe bar war was. There were lots of large groups out and this is before the music.  It was a good mix of people but there were a lot of 20-somethings.  \n\nI'm not sure who the band was but it was just a guitar player and drummer.  I'm always a fan of bands being set up and soundchecking prior to when they are supposed to start, but this band didn't and that's for another review.  When we arrived, we couldn't tell if they were still having live music because there was nothing set up anywhere. The band could use a better PA system that is more conducive to being able to make out the words he is singing.  \n\nWe found seats against the back wall (where the TV for playing video games used to be) and were served promptly.  We ordered food and it was fantastic.  My wife got some stuffed avocado thing and I got a 'Hand-Spanked' burger with tots.   The burger was truly fantastic.  Very reminiscent of the ClubHouse and the portion of tots was more than I ended up eating.  \n\nThey always have a good beer selection and post the draft beer list on the back chalkboard.  I like to just see the taps with the handles to make a list but I know it is easier the way they do it.  \n\nOnly 'complaint' is that the Men's restroom could use some help.  One of the urinals was out of order and you can tell that it appears they don't put alot of effort into the restroom.  It could use some sprucing up to return it to how cool it was when they first remodeled it.  \n\nI am interested in going back for more live music to see if the sound system other band's bring is any better.  May be a decent, but pricey, investment for The Dive to put their own system in.",

      "text": "Okay. Here's the low down. This is probably THE BEST BURGER SPOT in ALL of Lafayette. The quality of service, the variety of options, the location, the venue itself, the price, all of it. You just have to go there to get the full effect. But here's my breakdown.\n\nThe good. \n- Bru Burger is located in downtown Lafayette right next to the train station and foot bridge into West Lafayette. It's an easy walk here after going to the Farmer's market downtown or if you're touring Purdue and want to walk over.\n- It's easy on your wallet. You get what you pay for. Good food isn't (usually) cheap and cheap food isn't (usually) good. So yes, it's more expensive than McDonalds. That being said, you can get an artisan burger for $11-14. It's not going to break the bank like many other restaurants of the same caliber might.\n\nThe better.\n- The service is good. Very good. Employees seem to enjoy their work, and are super friendly. They keep finding quality employees. The management doesn't seem very involved in a visible role (no one comes around asking how everything is, etc.), but your waiter or waitress takes such good care of you that it doesn't matter. And I'm sure management is doing their job well, albeit behind the scenes.\n- The venue. It's trendy, modern, and fun. Their side patio is ideal for outdoor dining. The screen walls come down in the winter and its heated to provide excellent outdoor dining even in the cold. And nothing beats eating a Bru burger outside in the warm spring breeze.\n\nThe best.\n- Yup. I saved the best for last: the food. \n- WOWZA. The burgers are delicious, and I've had nearly all of them (not at the same time). Not that hungry? Build your own starting with a \"burger snack\" base for the perfect miniature burger.\n-The fries. Dining with a friend? Get the appetizer fries. It's like twice the cost as a side of fries for about 4 times the amount. Plus, it's served with their homemade black pepper mayo. I repeat for the people in the back...GET THE BLACK PEPPER MAYO.\n- Get. The. Nachos. You'll thank me later. Especially if you're getting a takeout order, the pork nachos are the best thing on the menu. The queso, the pickled jalapeños, the pico, the seasoned pork, all of it. It'll blow your mind.\n\nThey have some locations in Indy which are also good, but the one here in Lafayette is my favorite. You won't be sorry you came here.",

      "text": "We happened on this place 6 weeks ago when things were still very very quiet in Lafayette. Enjoyed our burger and beer so much that, coming through here again, I made a reservation for outside seating on a Saturday night. When we arrived it was MUCH busier - including a \"packed\" (by our new Covid parameters) indoors. The servers were so busy that at first I worried we would be forgotten. This was completely not the case! Though our server did take a few minutes to get to us (again because he was busy with others), our drink order came out VERY quickly and our food followed shortly. The fries were so crisp I had a hard time not eating them all immediately. Our two burgers (Mexicali and Greek Lamb) were done exactly as ordered and we got to sample 4 different beers including some local Indiana brews. I was so impressed with how the operation was run this night that I asked to speak to the manager to give my compliments. Since we are now driving between Atlanta and Minneapolis instead of flying, I anticipate that we will be in Lafayette again and when we are, I will look forward to another Burger & Beer meal!",

They employ a ton of staff so they keep up with the volume once you're in. The burgers are obviously the go to here and you really can't go wrong with any choice. I had the Patty Melt, which may seem a little underwhelming, but boy did it pack a ton of flavor. They cook your burger exactly how you want it too which is nice. The only flack is that the side portions of fries (while delicious) are a little small.",

      "text": "It pains me to write this review, because I like this restaurant, but I had a very bad experience on my last visit. Let me preface this by saying that the food was ok. We tried something different with the impossible Hiki'ole (which tasted like a meat burger and was pretty good) and the black bean burger (which I really didn't like). \n\nAs in my previous review, I've touted Bru Burger to be one of the best places to eat at/ take out food from during COVID. For that reason, we have been getting curbside pickup here regularly. On my last order, as usual, we called to put in the order for curbside pickup, at which point we checked that they would do curbside pickup, to which the person over the phone said yes. When it was time to make the pickup, after I drove up to the restaurant and gave them a call, the staff member that answered the phone was very rude. They told me that I need to come into the restaurant and that they don't do curbside pickup on he weekend (because they do the open air dining on weekends). Upon telling them that I checked about curbside pickup just 15 minutes prior (when I put in the order), I was told that maybe the person who took the order wasn't aware of what they claimed. When I said that I've gotten curbside pickup before, I was told that if I'm not going to come in and get the food, they don't know what else they can do for me. Since I wasn't going into the restaurant (for personal reasons) and stated so, the staff member finally gave in and brought the food out to me. At this point, they made a fuss about me having to sign the bill, which I've never had to do here before. They've always brought the food out to my car and left it in the trunk. The staff member wouldn't give me the food till I signed the check. I signed the check, but I was very disappointed with this experience.",

This visit in particular was to celebrate my graduation from Purdue. \n\nWe had the triple dip & each had a burger w/fries or onion rings. I do wish more bread was served with the dip, but they quickly brought us extra. We also had a bowl of chili - new to me and definitely something I'd order again. Hands down, the BRU Onion Rings are THE BEST I've ever had. The burgers were also good - the only potential drawback was they weren't exactly cooked as requested. \n\nThanks for a great celebration!",

      "text": "I have been to most of the Indiana Cunningham Restaurants, so while headed home, I stopped for dinner in Lafayette.  I was lucky and found some free street parking on the next block and walked over.  I noticed there were a lot of customers seated on the patio having dinner already, but fortunately, I was able to grab a spot at the bar.\n\nInside, the room is very tastefully decorated with lots of dark wood.  The noise level was pleasant, not too loud.\n\nI was greeted by the bartender with a menu and water.  I wanted to get a burger, but wasn't hungry enough for one of their half pounders, so I asked about a smaller version.  They have a basic burger for a lower price and you can add the toppings of their specialty burgers for an extra $2.  So, I went with the smaller version of the Honey Chipotle BBQ Burger.  This was another one of those BMB (Big Mouth Burgers), but I was able to squeeze it down to manage.  The flavor was really good.  I liked the bacon with the BBQ and burger flavors.  \n\nI also had a Gorgonberry Pecan Salad.  I ordered the small (and was only charged for a small) but the thing nearly covered a large plate.  Wow!  I love this salad and get one almost every time I dine at one of the BRU restaurants.\n\nWait times were minimal and the bartender did a good job of checking in to make sure I was being taken care of.  \n\nVery good flavor with a nice setting.  Really like the ability to not have to over order.\n\nReview #3048",

      "text": "Note: according to staff, the \"veggie burger\" and the \"black bean burger\" are not vegan. Previous review was from opening week and the information I got was wrong. They still have the portabello mushroom sandwich and impossible burger which are vegan. My first time around, the waitress told me all I had to do was sub out the mayo to make the garbanzo and mushroom patty vegan. It'd be really nice for the menu to specify exactly why something isn't vegan, so that people that don't want to eat any animal products don't have to rely on the staff to know the difference. \n\nI'd say I'm much less excited about the place now that I know that my only choices are the portabello and the impossible if it's in stock.\n\nOLD review:\n\nI'm really happy with this burger joint! It's a regional chain with restaurants in Ohio, Kentucky, and (of course) Indiana. \n\nThe menu is very clearly marked to show which items are vegan or vegetarian. For vegans, the menu is pretty skimpy on the appetizer sides. It looks like it may be onion rings or the soft pretzel without the pub cheese (ask first if the pretzel has any butter). We skipped straight ahead to the salad.  \n\nWe tried the quinoa salad (spring mix, crispy quinoa, edamame hummus, cucumber, portobello, peppadew pepper jam, and white balsamic-orange vinaigrette). Not at all what I was expecting - the quinoa is mashed into a ball and fried. The rest of the salad comes kind of decomposed, with long slices of portobello. It was delicious. \n\nAnd...there are THREE vegetarian burgers:\n+ Impossible burger - we ordered medium well, and comes with vegan cheese, vegan mayo mustard, house ketchup, greens\n+ Garbanzo and mushroom patty (vegetarian)- it comes with mayo, we substituted for vegan mayo. Comes on an oat bun\n+ Black bean burger (vegetarian) - I'm not entirely sure what makes this one vegetarian and not vegan (did not try). \n\nFew other details: Staff was very friendly, and we were seated quickly. They have have a large selection of rotating local and regional beers, and a good number of wines by the glass on the menu. But no vegan desserts. \n\nQuite impressive to have this many vegan and vegetarian options, I'm sure we'll be back here next time we're in town.",

      "text": "Having walked past BRU, it looked like a decent place to try.  The outdoor area sold me!\n\nI brought two co-workers, but didn't want sit chummy with them since we're from different parts of the country.  The staff accommodated my request, and we got things going. \n\nOne got a burger (not an adventurous diner), and the other got the BBQ.  I, on the other hand, got the gorgonberry salad w/salmon.  Since I'd been in a hot/humid factory all day, the LAST thing i needed was a gut-buster meal.  I highly recommend this salad.  With the salmon, it had all sorts of flavors & textures to keep me from focusing TOO much on Mr BBQ's onion rings.  They looked GOOD, I have to say. \n\nGreat service from Abby!",

      "text": "We had wanted to try the one in Indy, but never had the opportunity, so when a BRU opened up here in Lafayette, we knew we had to try it out!\n\nWe went for lunch a week after it opened( it was busy, but we were able to get one of the last available tables. Our server, Nick, was fantastic! He made me feel way less weird about my...unpopular...meat preferences.\n\nWe didn't try any apps or desserts; I'm not really sure how anyone would have room (however, I will say that I may end up making a special trip for the whiskey fudge brownie, which sounds and looks delicious)! My husband ordered The Beginning Burger and fries, and I had the Honey-Chipotle BBQ burger. We both really enjoyed our burgers (mine was particularly massive); the fries were pretty good too (I  tried one, and they were pretty potato-y, which is the only way I like fries).\n\nAs for my burger specifically, it could be a bit messy to eat (mostly because pulled pork falls out easily), but the crunch from the onion ring adds great texture. It does have a bit of a kick (as the name implies), but it's not overbearing.\n\nThe decor is modern and streamlined, though conversations seem to carry throughout the room. The carpeted area with tables seems like it might be a bit cramped; navigating your way through to get to the bathroom can be a challenge.\n\nAll in all, we had an excellent experience, and we'll definitely be back!\n\nUpdate: We came back and brought our kids. The kids menu offers options that will appeal to most kids (burgers, nuggets, mac and cheese, popcorn shrimp, and grilled cheese), and the kids entrees come with a side and a drink. They're pretty competitively priced to comparable restaurants. My kids had the cheeseburger with onion rings and the mac and cheese with fruit. I thought the mac and cheese didn't have a lot of flavor, but my kids both loved their food.\n\nMy husband got the Beginning Burger and fries again, and I tried the Memphis BBQ Melt, which I highly recommend!",

Partially because it's close to Pay Less but also because I like that I can use their own online system and not give away money to third party delivery services.\n\nThe sushi is quite creative. They have a large variety of rolls and options and I think we almost always get maybe 4-5 small rolls and a noodle dish and a starter for a family of four adults. The special rolls are significantly larger in size (usually 6 pieces) while the smaller rolls are 8 pieces and bite sized.\n\nThey also sell Beijing duck at this restaurant that you have to order in advance. It's not truly authentic because the skin is not crispy, but it's still good roasted duck.\n\nI ordered the udon with beef a couple times mostly to make it a fuller meal but it is one of their weaker dishes.",

The miso soup was hot and flavorful. Green onions evident. I had spicy tuna, Boston and shrimp tempura rolls. All were great. Very fresh ingredients and delivered rapidly for a busy dining room. Good value for a nice, not fast food lunch. The menu is extensive. Will certainly want to try it again.",

Unfortunately you do have to go inside as they do not at present offer curbside pick up.\n\nI spoke to Janet/Jeanette over the phone who was a bit curt and seemed to be in a big rush to end the call.\nWe tried the following:\n1) shrimp sumai - this was pretty good albeit a little soggier than I'm used to.\n2) aged tofu - nice big pieces of tofu with yummy sauce on the side\n3) spider roll - I asked how many pieces are in an order of their regular rolls and was told 6, however only got 5 spider rolls. They were not well packed and two of the rolls had come apart (see photos).\n4) spicy girl roll - you get 8 pieces. Very yummy.\n5) Tokyo Chicken - comes with a side of rice and either soup or salad. To be honest, this dish tasted like it had been made a while ago... very soggy and not crispy at all. You are probably better off ordering this if eating in person rather than delivery/pick-up. Good portion! The miso soup was good.\n\nTotal cost - approx $50\n\nOverall the packaging and service was not the greatest but the food is good.\nI would give them another go!",

Not as good as Sushi Don.\n\nAlmost everything was prepared as described but a little on the bland side. Luckily there is chili pepper seasoning on every table. It was the perfect compliment if you like to dial in your spice level and saltiness. \n\nMy wife wasn't terribly impressed with the lunch sushi (spicy tuna & tempura chicken rolls) she said she had had better sushi from a gas station. Now that's sketchy. The chicken karaage were tiny bits of fried chicken that were over done and very dry. On the menu it looks like small fried chicken wings. Once I spiced up my ramen dish it was pretty good. Loaded with too many noodles and shy on broth. To taste the noodles alone, one would not humm with delight. What I mean is it's obvious they are pre boiled in bland water and tossed in at service. I wish the smaller places would take time to bring the noodles back to life within the broth. If anyone can steer me to a place not in Chicago that makes fresh noodles and prepares them properly I would be in your debt.\n\nI gave this a 2.8 out of 5.",

      "text": "A good experience about sums up what you can expect here as a dining experience -- not bad, but not excellent. The interior of the restaurant is pleasant, emulating a modernised/neon-ified Tokyo restaurant, black-stained wood and lacquer off-setting the colourful, glammy lights. The menu has a wide array of sushis, from the simple to the popular Americana rolls you can find in most sushi parlours across the country (Dragon roll, California roll, CC roll, etc.), as well as some other, cooked Japanese fare for those who might not be fans of raw fish, such as a small selection of udon, ramen, bento boxes, and so forth. \n\nI had a fried California roll with a stir-fried chicken yaki udon, and both were nice, though not the best versions I have ever tasted. I also had the \"hot tea\" (ostensibly green tea), and I was a little put-out to find that, however else they prepare the tea, they finish it off by blasting it in a microwave, given that the cup is far too hot to hold at first when they serve you it (which doesn't happen if the tea was heated or boiled on its own, then poured into the cup to be served). The service was a little bit chilly as well -- not rude, just sort of absent-minded or apathetic. So there are a few edges that could be smoothed out a little as far as the food quality and service goes, but, again, it is not bad, and I will definitely return.",

Tuna was very fresh, delicious and the avocado was perfect!\n\nWe did an order for pickup because hubby had a very short window for eating lunch.\n\nThey included a hot appetizer for crab Rangoon for free when we picked up our order. I don't know if this was a special, she really didn't say why, just that we were getting a free appetizer. It was six pieces and they were good, a little on the sweeter side but good.\n\nWe didn't get to try any ramen but based on the sushi order I will return to try more menu items.\n\nOf special note on the service, which was excellent and prompt. As I mentioned earlier hubby had a short window, and it started at 11:30. They open at 11:00 and it's 15 minutes away. So I called the night before, they graciously took my order when I explained the timing problem and were so helpful. And when my son and I arrived at 11:10 everything was ready to go even though we were 5 minutes early. This allowed us to have a nice, unhurried lunch where his meetings were held.\n\nI will definitely be dining at Katana again.",

      "text": "Went here on a Tuesday night with a group of about 12 people. The location is great considering that it shares the parking lot with Payless and other businesses in the area. The restaurant is much bigger than I expected with ample seating space. It wasn't very busy. I had made reservations for this place since I had a big group and they offered us the private room in the back, which is also their karaoke room. I was a bit concerned about a karaoke room in a restaurant, but they assured me that it won't disturb  the other customers. The private room was a big booth, essentially with a TV, speakers, mics and disco lights which doubled up as a private eating space. \n\nThe service was nice. As soon as I entered the room (I was the first person there), the manager came by to introduce himself and give me a lay of the land. He also offered to help me with any requests that I had. Service was prompt.\n\nI got the spicy miso soup with pork. Usually, I gravitate to good sushi and try to stay away from the pork dishes, but I had heard good things about their ramen and wanted to give it a shot. I was very impressed with their ramen. The spiciness was just the right amount of spicy, and the ramen was very flavorful. The meat was cooked beautifully and the egg was made to perfection. A couple of my friends got the same dish and it seemed that the dish was consistent across the board. Prices were decent. For Lafayette, I was very impressed with the whole package. I will definitely be back and maybe next time, try out the karaoke. \n\nVerdict: Get their ramen.",

It was bittersweet to hear that this new Korean restaurant opened up in the exact same location, but I'm glad I tried this place out anyways because everything was SO DELICIOUS. I was the only customer there because Purdue was on winter break, but I'm curious to know how busy this place is going to be during the school year. (Let's hope they do reservations)\n\nOrdered the Dol Sot Bibimbap (rice, meat, veggie & egg in a stone bowl) and LA Galbi (beef short rib with bones), and they were both perfect. And yes, they serve Banchan (medley of tiny side dishes). Their seaweed soup was also very flavorful and delicious.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try the Hae Mul Pa Jeon (seafood savory pancake), Bul Go Gi (marinated beef) and grilled pork belly because those are also staples! The interior was also remodeled and has that cozy-yet-chic farmhouse feel. The servers were very polite and attentive, and I enjoyed listening to K-Pop while I basically inhaled my meal. SO GOOD.",

I ordered Thai iced tea, a side of fried tofu, and a tofu sandwich with mayo. \nOnce my order was placed I waited outside for about 15 minutes - next time I'll order through the YELP app so I dont have to wait. They have a black bench to sit on but no outdoor seating to eat at.\nMy takeout food came in a nice little brown paper bag and the thai tea had a boba tea lid which made carrying everything so much easier. \nThe thai tea was not very sweet. However, what it lacked in sweetness it made up for in creaminess - over all, very yummy. \nThe sandwich was soooo good! It's a big sandwich for $7! The bread was toasted, tofu crispy, cilantro gave it a burst of flavor and freshness, and the pickled vegetables brought it all home with just enough acidity to rock your socks off. \nAnd last but not least was the fried tofu side. So perfectly crispy and the sauce gave it a wonderful tangy flavor. \nOverall I highly recommend this place. Order ahead so you dont have to wait, but even if you have to wait its really worth it.",

I definitely miss it since I don't live there anymore and was so glad to see Lafayette had a place that serves up both. This was my first time ordering here. I got the marinated pork sandwich for pick up. I loved it right away. The first bite alone was full of flavor! \n\nI think I'd give it five stars if the meat was just a little more savory, there was a little more filling, and if the bread was fresher (felt a little stale). \n\nAll in all, a super satisfying 7 dollar sandwich! I'm definitely coming back to order pho and more sandwiches!",

      "text": "This review is mostly for the banh mi, because that was the only item I ordered personally, but I have to comment on the nuoc cham because I tried some! Got the classic /dac biet combo banh mi. I didn't try the meats individually (should have!), but I liked the savoriness and how they tasted. Pickled carrots and radish were a little on the sweet side, but I liked how they were cut (not too thick nor thin), liked how they gave a generous portion of the pickles, and that they used English cucumbers for an actual crunch, and that jalapenos were not omitted! I really enjoyed the shattering and flaky crust on the bread, and that it wasn't TOO crusty or hard to cut the soft palette or to be semi-compressed (in order to eat all components in one bite). My friend got the fried tofu, which she loved, but I tried some of her nuoc cham with some of the tomatoes/cucumbers that came with it, and encouraged her to try some on her rice! She didn't like the nuoc cham, and I was disappointed that it was overwhelmingly fishy and sweet, almost like it was missing the lime juice to balance it out, because I have fond memories of almost drowning my broken rice in nuoc cham. Most definitely will be back for the banh mi, but would wait to order any rice dish because of the off-putting nuoc cham!\n\nThe above review was written 3 months ago, after my first visit to BMEatery. \nMy 4 star rating that I posted on google is now docked to a 3.5 (but I will round to 4)- had the combo banh mi again today, but also tried the marinated pork to see how their version tastes. It was so sweet that I actually dribbled fish sauce on the pork every 2-3 bites to balance out the sweetness. I could mostly only taste the sugar, and a tiny bit of lemongrass when I bit into a minced piece. Would not recommend the marinated pork for this reason, and also would hesitate further due to the small amount, because the pork didn't appear until several bites of just bread+pickled carrots+radish. \nI noticed that this time they used non-English cucumbers, and all 3 of our sandwiches only had one piece of cucumber about 4 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide :(",

Everything on the menu is good and the service is excellent, even when the place is completely full. They make the pizzas behind a glass window right next to the front door as you enter. Parking can be an issue, but there is a constant turn over. Be patient for a few minutes and someone will be leaving shortly. You can call ahead to reserve a table and of course, there is carry out as well.",

I've gone here pre-COVID-19, but this review is in regards to their current take-out. The quality and service did not falter by any means. The pizza was ready and hot to take home and everything was nicely packed. There were many people on staff and everything seemed working like a machine, organized and quick. So many moving hands knowing what to do, working diligently and fast. They were very happy to see us and grateful for our loyalty. Their pizza was fresh, super filling, and extra cheese? Yeah, it really means extra cheese and we were very thankful for it!",

Bruno's is a true family business, and the standards have never once changed. While I have never tried any of their pasta dishes, I have no reason to believe they aren't fantastic. The pizzas are always great. Even with COVID-19 limiting the business to carry-out only, I have never had a bad pizza from Bruno's. The inside of the restaurant is a must-see for Purdue fans. Big O's collection of Purdue memorabilia is truly special. I look forward to the day when I can dine-in again!",

It was packed on a Friday night, and I loved the dim lighting and casual feel of the place. The gentleman who served us was very friendly and polite, despite the rush hour.\n\nIn terms of the pizza... I got the Bruno's veggie with jalapeños as extra topping (14 inch, came to approx $20). To be honest, I was quite disappointed. They definitely like their cheese, which I'm a big fan of, but it looked like the cheese had been poured over the toppings, so the toppings were quite soggy under all of that melted goo. The crust and base were not impressive and were a little harder than I'd like. \n\nI might go back to try a non-veg pizza, but if you're a vegetarian looking for a good veggie pizza, I can't recommend Bruno's.",

Generations of Boilermaker faithful love this place, and I suspect generations more will too, but not me. I've had enough. \n\nThe pizza ingredients are good, but I prefer mine fully baked, thank you. There's not a square inch of browned cheese in sight at Bruno's. Melted, yes, for the most part. Browned? Ah, no. The restaurant has a very loud sports-themed dining room, covered in sports memorabilia. At full capacity, this room is a claustrophobic cacophony of screaming kids, ESPN, and birthday parties. The Swiss room plays homage to the original Bruno location across State Street, which had a Swiss chalet feel. Chalk that location up to progress and new roads. There's a bar room in the back. \n\nThe best thing on the menu - an antipasto meat and cheese plate - is no more. The final straw was when we were refused a take out cup for WATER. Classic. We got the Heisman on grandma's request for a cup of water for the road. Two pizzas, two sodas, all for $45, mediocre service for free. Sorry Boiler Nation, I won't return to Bruno's. Overrated and overpriced.",

      "text": "This was a favorite restaurant of my husband during his time at Purdue several years ago. After a few visits on our own, and now with kiddos, it is one of my favorites as well! At first glance one could think their menu is what you'd expect to see at a standard pizza joint - but upon closer glance you'll find some really unique menu items: Apple butter & PB dipping sauce for the Bruno Dough on the kids menu, chicken livers on the spaghetti a la caruso, and even a cheese and peanut butter pizza!\n\nMy favorite bits about Bruno's:\n-Memorabilia everywhere - all signed with the owner, Orlando's name! It is clear that he is well-loved. And, my toddler LOVES to explore the restaurant to check it all out. \n-The bruno dough - basically donuts made of pizza dough (8 per order). We get it with the meat sauce, which is also the same meat sauce used in the pasta dishes. It is outstanding.\n-They're kid friendly - meaning they've got a kids menu with decent portions of real food, they serve milk, they provide crayons and paper, and they have slings and booster seats available.\n-The house salad reminds me of the mixed vegetable salads from my time studying in Germany. It comes with radishes, egg, chopped beets, shredded carrots, and more. Yum. :)\n\nMy only beef with Bruno's is that the tap water tastes a little bit off. I don't know any other way to put it, but if you're between a water and a beer, get a beer. ;)",

The chef competed on masterchef and the food is most certainly evidence of why he was selected as a competitor. Incredibly well balanced flavors, creative construction, and well executed food made for a fantastic dining experience. The portions are extremely generous given the quality and intensity of flavor. Highly highly recommended!",

      "text": "I have traveled a lot for work on expense accounts and I haven't been able to find many restaurants worth going to around here, so I generally don't eat out. I was really impressed with Bowen Bistro's quality of ingredients for the price.\n\nI know there are some not great reviews, but I think when you go, you need to take your server's recommendations. We ordered an appetizer and asked her if it was good, and she said it was ok. She was right, it was just ok. However, we ordered her two favorite dishes, the crispy skin salmon and the aged NY strip, and they were DELICIOUS. You would pay about 30% more for the same quality of ingredients elsewhere. The crispy skin salmon is one of the best things I have eaten at any restaurant ever including restaurants in Chicago, San Francisco, NYC, New Orleans, etc. The mashed potatoes are so good we ordered an extra side.\n\nWe will definitely be back. Oh my goodness, and the bourbon cake and tiramisu are incredible. I was surprised they were handmade. I can't wait to go back and try the duck, and of course, get the perfect crispy salmon again!",

      "text": "My partner and I went to Bowen's for lunch and had a GREAT experience. It was a creative, fun lunch menu that pokes into high-end cuisine. We started with an appetizer of the Ahi Poke, which was a really flavorful bite before digging into our main dishes. For our mains, I had the Unadon, which was really tasty, but also really beautifully prepared as you can see in the photo. My partner had the Wagyu Gyudon which was a really warm, comforting dish. \n\nOne of the best moments of our experience was Bowen's pleas to try the marble soda. I had never heard of it, so I was kind of reluctant to try it. But Bowen was so excited and proud about serving the \"good stuff\" and brought out a bottle to kind of show us what it was all about. We got a bottle and it was certainly worth it. If you go, you really do have to try it. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can really feel Bowen's heart in the food and the experience. It was the highlight of our day.",

      "text": "Identity crisis. \n\nBowen Bistro has a bit of an identify crisis. I get the Asian fusion thing, but there are also standouts on the menu that seem way out of place (New Orleans salmon, Spaghetti and meatballs). \n\nUpon entering, there is a marquee that says \"Fine Dining\"; however places that are actually fine dining, don't need to announce it. On the table, the salt and pepper are cradled in a kitschy chef character. Not a problem, but not fine dining.  \n\nThere is a section called crepe omelets, I asked what makes them crepe and the server said, they are just omelets. No problem, but why include \"crepe\" in the name. \n\nI had the wagyu omelet ($16), it was really tasty. Their dishes are stand alone, which I am fine with, but there are no al a carte sides that you can order. \n\nBowen (the chef/owner) came out to greet us, which is a nice touch. He's a young guy and really nice! I hope he can lose the seriousness of the restaurant and just make it young and fun like him! Lean into the kitsch!",

With much anticipation, you did not disappoint!  We ate the Surf and Turf with Filet Mignon and Shrimp, Yukon Gold Mashed Potatoes with Multi Vegetable Purée that looked like a rainbow on our plates.  In addition, the desserts are sumptuous and not to be missed either; we each ordered a different one!  I'm also looking forward to you having your liquor license next week so I can have a glass of wine with dinner. We look forward to many future visits!",

The Hawaiian Avocado Tartare was creative and refreshing;  the Sukiyaki Wagyu Gyudon was an ultimate comfort food on a cold day; the Truffle Four-Cheese Ravioli was creamy and tasty. The service was okay, but some things remain to be worked out. Don't tell a table you can't do something \"because you expect so many more people to come\" (they never did show up).  Unfortunately, it is right now not a restaurant I plan to take visitors to (given the prices, it needs Purdue visitor business). The setup with two unprotected doors that let cold air in, the lighted billboard over the bar,  windows all around with most of them looking at a gas station and people pressing their noses against the glass, make the environment uninviting. Some of these issues can be addressed and hopefully they will.",

The salmon and the shrimp that accompanied it, were both undercooked and under-seasoned. Additionally, the dishes were served one at a time with a 20-minute lag between the first and last dish -- resulting in the initial dishes being cold. Dishes were overpriced given the quality of food. We had high expectations; hopefully they can turn things around quickly.",

Seated quickly.  Seats were well spaced.Very nice atmosphere.  Noted that someone was consistently cleaning and spraying tables and seats. Daughter ordered French toast with strawberries on the side, . I ordered big breakfast included scrambled eggs , hash browns, bacon, toast. We cross shared our orders. I ordered coffee it was strong but I did enjoy it. Just what I needed to wake up.The waitress saw we were sharing and brought extra plates. She went above and beyond. Will definitely eat here again.",

      "text": "One of the best West Lafayette dining options serving all day breakfast on a huge menu, wonderful value, enticing options with Mediterranean flair and popular American grill eats, friendly staff, and classically modern atmosphere. Us eight hungry guys dropped in a bit late, were reminded we needed to order as they closed at 9:00, still managed a great time with all of our picks finding the pasta almost hilariously piled high, burgers actually two hands, and I went for the hero quesadilla appetizer thinking my two tacos would be the usual tiny amount of food. But happily my two shells were stuffed full of Chipotle sauce ripe for a filling meal. These local family restaurants can easily be overlooked due to popular chains offering predictable menus but I am very thankful to recommend Christos as well and above all the usual national restaurants in the area for value, variety, and an overall excellent time despite an early closing time.",

      "text": "I've been here several times over the years. Christos is never a first choice destination for me, but if someone else suggests it, I'm fine going along. At three stars, \"A-OK\" is a positive and acceptable rating. So go visit for any meal of the day and enjoy, chances are highly likely you'll have good food and catch good vibes from the pies and ambiance. Christos has a \"we're a small restaurant group but we're not really a chain\" independent feel.\n\nI think it's annoyingly loud in this restaurant, depending on where you are seated. I was in a booth near the back last time and it was fine, until others were seated around us. At that point it felt like we were inside of a megaphone. So is it bad acoustics or do I just get seated near loud talkers all the time, or do I have sensory overload disorder? Not sure. The service was good. My gluten-free friend really enjoyed the bunless burger, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I found the fish tacos OK but not stellar. The fries were done but were almost colorless; another 30-60 seconds in the fryer would've crisped them up.",

They have a good variety of menu items, and breakfast is available all day.\n\nI almost always order the Gyro Breakfast Skillet. It's basically a deconstructed gyro on a bed of potatoes and topped with two eggs. It's a very filling meal and great any time of the day! My son tried out their Chorizo Burger. It was so large that he had a hard time fitting it into his mouth. He ordered chicken noodle soup as his side, and the rest of the table wished they had ordered some.\n\nOur server was very friendly and upbeat, stopping by many times to make sure we had everything we needed. \n\nThey have a tempting selection of desserts in the front case, but we are always too full to try any. \n\nChristos is always a solid choice, anytime of the day.",

Favorites include the rancher's breakfast, triple double, the turkey club, their fries and their mashed potatoes. Taco salad (\"broken taco\") is also pretty excellent.

They're quick, COVID-concious, and my tummy is happy.",

      "text": "I love poke!  And I really appreciate that this restaurant opened at 10 a.m. so that I could grab a bite to eat at 10:30 without having to kill time waiting around. \n\nI have had poke at several places around Indy, so I was pleasantly surprised when the regular size bowl was about 2 cups instead of the massive bowls I've had elsewhere.  I had a lot of things to do and didn't need to feel stuffed!  \n\nI didn't see any \"pre-conceived\" options on the menu board behind the counter, so I just followed the order and direction from the server on building my bowl.  Size then rice type (brown) were followed by protein choice (Ahi Tuna).  After that, they have a no limit choice of add ins and some that were an additional $.50 per selection (avocado and pineapple).  You also get a choice of sauce (Eel) and a couple toppers (lobster salad and shrimp).  I declined adding more toppers since by bowl was already overflowing.\n\nThe only negative I see is that when the bowl is filled, it is hard to stir it all up to get a blending of flavors until some of the bowl is consumed.\n\nI also don't know why there have been so many comments about the expense.  If you want fresh food, hand prepared, it will cost more than a burger joint.  And frankly, I found the regular size perfectly fine for lunch (and I had just walked four miles followed by another six that afternoon.)\n\nI really enjoyed my meal and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy and fresh alternative for lunch.\n\nReview #1134",

I like that you can choose whatever toppings you like, but I really think it's a hit or miss with which employee you get and how large your portion will be.  Some of the ingredients don't taste as fresh, such as the vegetables or even tuna/salmon, so that's why I give it three stars instead.  It's not terrible, but it's not the best I've had!

I got a large bowl with salmon, edamame, cucumbers, seaweed salad, ponzu and spicy mayo, scallions, and tempura topping. \n\nMy first complaint is the rice. It's dry and a little hard. Pretty low quality rice. There was a lot of salmon which is awesome but it had very little texture and flavor. Everything else was generally fine but as those were the main components of my dish, I was a little disappointed. \n\nI think one of their strong points is that they give a lot of toppings.

      "text": "I was at Purdue for a conference, and stopped in for a quick weekday lunch at Poke Hibachi.  The service is indeed quick -- fast casual, order at the counter style. It's very small inside, so you may not find seating if they're busy. \n\nMy friend and I split a large poke bowl (around $13 including tax and a 50 cent up-charge for adding avocado), and it was enough food for a decent meal for two people, which was a great value.  They sell hibachi (cooked proteins -- mostly meat or fish -- with veggies and rice), as well. You can choose from a variety of raw and cooked seafood proteins, and there's a tofu option for vegans/vegetarians.  The food was fresh and tasted good -- standard tasty poke bowl fare, with lots of good options for sauces and toppings.\n\nThe portion was almost too generous for the size of the bowl I had -- I asked for a mix of brown rice and greens as a base, and was given so many greens that the bowl was basically impossible to mix: you need to eat all the good toppings off first, and are then left with plain rice and lettuce at the bottom. I'm not complaining about big portions; it was very generous. But it might be better in a larger bowl.\n\nSpeaking of bowls: there's no recycling container (at least as far as I could see), in spite of the fact that all of the bowls used are plastic and presumably recyclable. \n\nBonus, though: the chopsticks are smooth and rounded, unlike the rough-edged, stuck together wooden chopsticks most places have.  No splinters here!",

AND NOBODY SQUIRTS IT ON TOP THE RICE. \n\nAlso, all the topping and stuff you put on the poke--no one makes poke like that. Just a way to get away with giving you practically no fish. \n\nI've never been more depressed to be in Indiana.\n\n( Tbh, the lady who served me was nice.

I took one bite of the ginger and immediately noticed a spoiled and rotten taste. I love poke and came to visit from Chicago and did not expect to be ripped off like this.

(Hey, Fiesta Mexican Grill: You all should totally consider selling your tortillas a la carte!) \n\nIn fact, my whole pork barbacoa burrito tasted quite a lot like the pork barbacoa burritos from Cafe Rio. So, if you're looking for a Cafe Rio substitute, this Mexican restaurant might fit the bill. \n\nThe rice here is not my favorite, but it's not NOT good -- it just tastes like instant rice. They only have one type of rice option here (cilantro lime), but I wish they would consider also offering Mexican rice. \n\nThe ordering system is set up like Chipotle, in that you tell them what you want (burrito, tacos, nachos or quesadilla), and then you can customize it however you want. Protein offered is shredded chicken, shredded beef, pork barbacoa, grilled chicken and grilled steak. You can also get your meal vegetarian (which does not come with a protein). \n\nBecause this restaurant is located near Purdue University, it can get pretty busy with students filtering in and out. Also, there isn't much parking on the street. We ended up parking in the parking garage located across the street from the restaurant.",

      "text": "I was disappointed in Fiesta. Maybe I was expecting too much from the high Yelp rating, or was it an off-day for the ingredients? I ordered one of the most popular items, the chicken burrito - enchilada style - with the cheese and sauce on top. To start, Fiesta makes their own tortillas in the store, cooked on a circular flat top. Pretty cool! The ingredients looked fresh, service was fast, and the staff were friendly. I stopped in for an early lunch, and by the time I left the line was 15+ deep. This place obviously has a following. \n\nThe final product looked good but suffered from several problems. First, the tortilla was doughy. I don't know if it was undercooked or too thick, but it was like chewing a mushy washrag. Second, the rice was too wet, soaking the tortilla even more from the inside. Third, the chicken, beans, and rice filling were not hot enough. I ended up discarding the wet tortilla and scooping up the ingredients with my high-priced side order of chips.  I thought the Diet Coke was flat. Overall 2.5 stars.\n\nWhat are best in class items here? If they can get the tortillas cooked right, I think that is a big draw, and the salsa is very fresh and tasty. The lettuce was good too. I'll give Fiesta another try sometime, but I won't go out of my way for a repeat visit.",

We really appreciate that, unlike some other places, they've continued doing contactless curbside pickup, even after they reopened their dining room. Some of the dishes we've had and really enjoyed this summer include the pecan crusted trout, the mushroom cavatappi in marsala cream sauce, the burrata caprese salad and the french onion burger. I like that they change their menu seasonally because most other restaurants around here don't, and even great menus get boring when they've been offering the exact same food for years. It's definitely pricey for the area (entrees, especially ones containing seafood, can be $30+) but the food puts them up there among the best restaurants in greater Lafayette.",

      "text": "I'm kind of torn between 4 and 5 stars but am erring on the side of generosity primarily because I think restaurants should be supported in these Covid-19 times and Bistro 501 deserves special mention for having curbside no-contact pickup, which not all restaurants do. The food is also excellent-- the French Onion burger, which is what I always get when my wife and I visit our daughter and her family and get food from here, may very well be the best hamburger I have eaten in Lafayette. \n\nThere are two reasons, though, that I am a little ambivalent about giving 5 stars. The first is the fairly skimpy menu, at least as far as I am concerned. The primary reason that I always get the French Onion burger is that there really aren't any other entrees that I like all that much. There are nine entree items, only two of which involve red meat (I'm a carnivore); the other items include seafood, vegetarian, and chicken or hen selections. The other meat item, filet mignon, looks good, but I'm not about to pay 44 dollars for a steak.  \n\nAnd that brings me to the second reason: the prices. 18 dollars for a burger? That seems kind of ridiculous, given that this restaurant is in Lafayette, Indiana, not New York City. It is, as I noted above, a first-rate burger, but I don't really believe it's worth 18 bucks. \n\nBottom line: very good food and a nice place to patronize if you're nervous about eating out or having contact with strangers, but meat eaters may find the pickings a bit slim and I'm not sure the quality of the food justifies the prices. A great place to eat, though, if you're looking for a special treat, trying to impress a date or are taking a job candidate out to dinner.",

      "text": "Literally the best food I've had in the Lafayette area! The atmosphere here is excellent and the food and service are really superb. It's pricier but you get what you pay for here. Definitely an elegant place to have drinks, go on a date, or just have a nice night out! You really can't go wrong with any of the drinks or food on the menu.\n\nThis location is busy and parking in the area can be difficult. Get an early start looking for parking if you have a reservation during peak hours. The staff will call and check up with you to see if you're still coming if you are running late. I was--driving in circles looking for a spot, d'oh!--but they held my table without issue.\n\nMy server was super nice and the manager was beyond delightful. She really took the time to connect with the many guests there and made me feel super welcome. I'm so excited about their future endeavors and will definitely be back!\n\nI had a coconut drink (so good!!), bread/butter, a gorgeous salad, a duck confit dish, and creme brûlée. Everything exceeded my expectations and was so wonderful to enjoy. \n\nI can't wait to take some guests to this restaurant in the near future!",

We had the shrimp tempura and Tuscan bruschetta as our first course ( exquisite !!!) for our main course we both had the pork chop ( seasonal / on temporary menu that the chef releases frequently ) and it was AMAZING.

There is so much to enjoy here from the wonderful staff, tastefully decorated inside and out, and a traditional blend of French cuisine with American flair. I came here for my birthday for the first time with my group of four others and all enjoyed dishes from soup, duck, lobster to beef. The Burger was the surprise, easily the most Fantastic Burger I have ever had in my life. What an amazing blend of ingredients that come together for flavors making many steaks embarrassed. The duck poutine was also a stand out, amazed us all! My lobster and crab cannelloni was rich and even though the cream and ricotta took over most of the dish there was some nice flavors poking through. Good words also for the soups and boeuf bourgignon - pure delicious beef and extremely well done with very soft and tasty morsels. The drinks were also well crafted, the desserts very nice, and we will definitely be back for another celebration.",

      "text": "A chic French bistro with country charm and incredible cuisine -- what's not to love about Bistro 501?\n \nAlthough I'm not a Lafayette local, I travel here frequently for business and this has become my go-to for sit-down meals. Most recently, I stopped in for an early lunch during the busy Christmas shopping season. While I didn't have a reservation, I was quickly seated. The staff was very attentive, taking my order and then bringing out my meal before the dining room filled up for the big lunch rush.\n \nThe menu always features seasonal and sophisticated dishes. This time I started with a cup of sugar pumpkin and wild rice soup, which was perfectly rich and creamy -- just as a French soup should be! For my main course, I ordered the humongous beet and goat cheese salad, which was well appointed with lots of other goodies like wild rice, pepitas and oranges. I added salmon, which turned out to be a full portion. The whole dish was so flavorful it could easily stand on its own, but a few touches of the creamy apple cranberry dressing put it over the top!\n \nThe beautiful details -- lovely old portraits, antiques and carved wood finishings -- throughout the dining room make a spectacular backdrop for the meal.\n \nKeep in mind, this is an upscale French restaurant, so you should expect to pay a little more. But the portions are large and the overall experience is well worth it.",

The whole staff is professional and experienced. We had the Turkish lentil soup which was slightly sweet and hardy, really delicious. The pork chop was so soft and cooked perfectly. The broccolini pasta was amazing, creamy and perfect texture with the walnut crust. Props to the chef and the owner. The place does has strange hours and is always booked so make sure to call to make a reservation even if they aren't open. You can leave a voicemail and they'll call you back.",

Fine Dining in the home of Astronauts, Engineers, a world renowned Collegiate Music Organization (with no music degree available?!?) and a big-a$$ bass drum... who'da thunk it!\n\nOn this early December evening The French inspired Bistro provided a spectacular meal and impeccable service as a Lafayette Christmas parade floated by. \n\nA table next to a warm easy burning fireplace for the evening, at least 2 1/2 hours, made way to signature cocktails, beginnings of meat and cheeses followed by delicious and beautifully presented pasta's, chops, fish and steaks accompanied by a bottle of red and a bottle of white (nod to B. Joel) from the Bistro's superb cellar.\n\nThe evening was finally closed with shared desserts, in Funkster fashion, and an aromatic and rich cup of French roast, naturally from... a French press.\n\nIt truly was L'Amour from first bite, just remember to have plenty of Francs on hand - even though dead presidents is easier.\n\nWill we return? Well as my good friend PePe Le Pew has said, \"One nice thing eez, the game of love eez never called on account of darkness!\"",

      "text": "My previous review from 2015 was a 3, and the reason for it was that it was an \"institution\" and so while the food was just okay you kind of knew were you stood with it. \n\nWell. Bistro kind of took us for a terrible ride when we were planning our rehearsal dinner spot for our wedding. My mom hosted the rehearsal, so we planned her visit to Lafayette so she could try the two choices (Bistro and East End). My now husband's parents came along as well as a treat. We tried basically everything in the menu that was vegetarian**. The food was okay, but not mind blowing. Still, it's the type of atmosphere that my parents prefer, so they were leaning toward hosting the dinner at Bistro for about 30 people. However, despite having talked to my mom before, and knowing that she was the one paying, the manager just kept on addressing only my husband's parents. Was it because they're American and my mom has a thick accent? (despite being fully fluent?) I don't know, that was kind of our assumption. At some point my mom said \"excuse me, I'm the one that's hosting\" and the manager said something really awkward like \"yes, of course I know\" just to go back to ignoring her. Anyway, maybe this all seems like a bunch of petty stuff, but mediocre food (see previous review), poor manners, and feeding me fat duck (see note below). Just no.\n\n** pretty sure, as I found out later, their fries are fried in duck fat, and we talked several times about how we were vegetarians at that time, so wtf. Extra wtf.",

She said since this is a half order this I the amount we give. I said okay and ended the conversation. Then, from her side she said and I quote her' you get what you pay for, if you want more soup be ready to pay another 4$ for it'. Hearing her say this and bring up money I told her politely it doesn't matter giving a little extra soup if it satisfies the customer. And then she said it matters to us the quantity we give and told me we are happy to not serve customers who are unsatisfied. I said then 'okay thank you, maybe I will not come back ' again in a polite way. I left and she came outside the restaurant while I was going toward my car and said' it will be our honor not to serve you'.\n\nThis is an extremely bad service and impolite behavior.

But, we go to a restaurant and if the food is food and place place is clean, it is easy bear all other issues. And yes, the food is good and authentic. Worth trying if you are around- you won't be disappointed.",

The lamb is tender and and the rice is the perfect amount of spicy. If you prefer you can also get the dish with chicken. \n\nThe staff are friendly and accommodating and the prices are great. Many foods come with the option of a half portion for a lower price, and honestly that has always been more than enough food for me (the attached photo is actually after I've eaten about half)\n\nCan't wait to come back soon!",

      "text": "I almost never have Middle Eastern food, but my friends and I were in the mood to try something completely new and expand our horizons. We found this place by chance and decided to give it a chance after seeing other positive reviews. \n\nThe place was much different than I expected on the inside. The decor was really interesting and aesthetically please. It was incredibly clean as well. Our waitress was really nice and friendly. She was also quite fast with taking out order and getting us our food. \n\nI started out with the lentil soup. I had never had anything like it before, but it was very good. I saved most of it to use as a palate cleanser when the spice of my main course started to overwhelm me. I would recommend trying it. It's finely pureed and has an interesting flavor.\n\nMy main course was the chicken biryani. I did really enjoy it, even though the spice was a bit much for me at times (tag in the lentil soup). I wish there had been more chicken. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. There was a ton of rice that wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI would definitely say it's worth a try. I enjoy trying something new and out of the ordinary, so this was a great choice for a random dinner.",

But could be better.  More Serious problem is, three of us who ordered lamb kebab, had diarrhea problem after dinner. \n\nPrice: 2 star, overpriced and couldn't tell the difference between a half/full size of hummus regarding the serving size.\n\nService: Negative 100.  The lady who served us dinner tonight was extremely rude and unprofessional. The were more than 4 (usually it would be 6 for other restaurant)of us, for sure she could get guaranteed 18% gratuity. Probably that's why we were treated like that. I, politely, asked her how long our food will take for coming, after 30mins wait, she rolled her eyes in my face. Interesting reaction. . Technically speaking, I don't think we did anything wrong or treated her in a unfair standing. We were being polite and patient meanwhile she made us feel we own her 10000 grants.",

Yeah you'll want to make sure you get those too. The fried pecan pie? You'll think you've died and gone to heaven.\n\nThe only thing that's a little lacking is the somewhat curt service, but the humble dining room and down-to-earth staff paired with authentic BBQ make it the perfect lunch spot for everyone, from a business meeting to the drywall tradesmen taking a break.",

      "text": "My Mom & I went to South Street Smokehouse today for lunch to go (they do not have a dine in option now). My mom is 92 and is hard of hearing.  In accordance with the Indiana Mask Mandate we are not required to wear a mask so that I can communicate to her. As we entered South St. the cashier told me we needed a mask. I said thanks but we have a mask exemption. ANY OTHER business here in town has been nice about this because this is a disability issue. One of the men behind the counter told me we needed a mask. I told him we had a mask exemption and asked if it was going to be a problem to order food to go. He asked another man who told me no they would not serve us. I asked again if they were refusing to serve us given that we had a masks exemption. He said yes and we left. I did not want to embarrass my mom as she had not heard what happened. There were 2 customers in there waiting for their food. We were not a threat to anyone. I sent South Street a FB message because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that they did not know. (screenshots below of my message, the exemption) and they responded in a very RUDE way. (Screenshot below) \"Please feel free to report the problem. Your moms hard of hearing doesn't justify you not wearing one. Please feel free to never enter MY ESTABLISHMENT again!\" They put up a post a couple of hours later that said they followed the Indiana Mask Mandate. They have now removed that post but I also have the screenshot of it. People that knew me had found out about this were commenting on the post. They have now deleted it. I left a bad review because they could have handled this very differently. I have also filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the US Dept of Justice. I sent them a copy via FB messenger but they have blocked me.\nIs this overkill? ... maybe but the rudeness of the response needs to be addressed. There are people with disabilities that are dealing with this pandemic. Why can't we be kind and help them? Would it have hurt them to let us order food, stand against the wall while we waited and then left? My mama loves BBQ and she was so excited about this but I told her we will not be going back. We will give our business to D&R!",

      "text": "I stopped by South Street on a business trip to West Lafayette hoping for some awesome BBQ. \n\nI will begin this review by saying that I am in love with excellent BBQ, and have been fortunate enough to enjoy some of the best across our great country. I take it very seriously and put a lot of effort into learning what makes great BBQ and how to make it happen. Although my personal BBQ results are varying levels of good, I have had the chance to enjoy what I consider to be excellent BBQ. \n\nThat being said, I was extremely hopeful of a great lunch on the cold January day of my visit. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. \n\nThis seems like a shop that should be able to do it right, and the place was packed during lunch, which makes me think that they are either usually better, or the bar is just not that high, their 4.5 star here on Yelp reinforces my hope that it is the former. \n\nOn to the food. I got my go to that I consider the standard scorecard of good BBQ...Sliced brisket and spare ribs. \n\nI knew I was in trouble as I began ordering. First of all, there was no combo or option on the menu for brisket and ribs, and when I asked for it I was told to buy two lunches, the brisket lunch, and the spare ribs lunch. It wasn't very expensive, just strange. As I was ordering I asked for my brisket to be a half fatty and half lean. The gentleman helping me looked at me like I was asking for something strange. Realizing that maybe they call the cuts point and flat I restated my order as that and got an equally quizzical look. When this happens I lose hope that they speak great BBQ. \n\nSure enough, when my food was ready I received all flat (lean) brisket, although it did have more fat cap than most prefer, so I expect that they believed that is what I meant by half fatty. \n\nThe brisket was very over cooked, when held sideways it broke right in half, which the novice would say means \"it is super tender right?\" Well, over cooked BBQ falls apart easily, but is super dry and loses all of the things that make excellent BBQ magic. The smoke ring was very light and the taste was that of oven roast beef, which is fine, just not great. \n\nThe ribs were dry and bland, they appeared to also be over cooked (no bark, just jerky on the outside) mushy texture. \n\nSides were beans and slaw, I tried a few bites of the beans, but moved on quickly, mainly due to lack of appetite at this point. Not a fan of sweet beans and these tasted like they came from a can, not bad jus not my preference and not special. At some of my favorite places, the brisket beans are my favorite after I finish the main event.  Never tried the slaw. \n\nI hope I caught them on a bad day, regulars would know better. \n\nRibs - 3/10\nBrisket 3/10\n\nNot a 1 star, but well below average.",

The food was decent I had BBQ chicken which was really good, the corn bread is a little corn tasting and they didn't have honey that was not expired so it made it taste a little off. The potato salad was really good. They have a few flavors of BBQ sauce they were all pretty good really. The people working didn't look like they wanted to be there which I mean nobody wants to be at work but a smile never hurt nobody. All in all it was OK at best.

Explain it well in their reviews.  How can you call yourself a smoke house when you don't smoke anything??  Brisket tasted like dry roast beef, 1/4 dark chicken was mushy and had no flavor, certainly never spent any time in smoke.  Or it was held in a steam table so long it lost all flavor?  If you like to add lots of sauce, their sauces are pretty good, but $25 for two lunches is way over priced for what it is.  I also have been to many BBQ joints, I can't understand how the other reviewers can say they've been to great BBQ joints and put this place in the same category.",

The soup, salads, and sushi/sashimi came out first. The fish here was very fresh and pretty good. Two of us got their dinner combo sets. This came out last, about 30 mins after ordering. However, portion size was very large, and most of it was pretty good. The combos do come with a stir fry of vegetables though which was basically a waste of space in the bento box.

If you haven't tried mackerel I recommend it. Their tempura is lovely. The vegetables were delicious. I lived in Japan for five years, lived (and learned to cook) with a Japanese family, worked as a Japanese-English translator. I know Japanese food, and the food at Heisei is excellent. I like the new setting (they moved a year or two ago); it's very spacious and relaxing. We were there tonight with little kids, and it's very family friendly.",

For the price, one would expect some richer broth, better cuts of meat, and higher quality noodles involved. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. \n\nThe tonkotsu, normally a rich pork bone broth created after a marathon of simmering, was flat and salty. It didn't have the usual signs of fresh-made creation: oils and fat bubbles or robust flavor. Instead, it just had a creamy color and had some spices lazily added.",

      "text": "I loved Heisei in its previous, decades-long incarnation in the Payless shopping center. Once it fled West Lafayette, we were left with a void that was shortly filled by Katana. Heisei has been back for a while now and I finally went after having become a regular at Katana.\n\nThe restaurant space is modern, bright, chic. All solid surfaces, so it's a little loud in there. The sushi counter is pretty nice. Wooden table around an interesting sushi setup. I liked the look of the place.\n\nStaff were ok. A little slow but not that bad. \n\nI ordered the sushi & sashimi combo lunch. It was served with both salad and miso. Lucky me! The salad was very poor. They either don't dry the lettuce or use a very watery dressing. It's the classic \"pool\" at the bottom of the salad bowl. Not good. The miso was nice and tasty. I applaud that effort.\n\nThe lunch came with four sashimi, four nigiri and a small roll half cucumber, half chopped fish of some sort.\n\nSashimi was so-so. I liked the octopus and clam but the actual fish was not as fresh as I expect from a good sushi place. Nigiri was the same story. Just blah.\n\nSushi roll came with Nori on the outside. Who's still doing that? The roll was the quality I would expect from crappy college campus sushi places.\n\nOn the whole, this fish was just not *nearly* as high quality as Katana and it was not as fresh. One piece was actually semi-frozen still. Attention to detail. \n\nI would suggest Katana over Heisei for sure. Prices are about the same.",

I am told that its history dates back to a decision wise Subaru executives made back in the day to hire in a sushi chef to provide landlocked Hoosiers with quality sushi. Today the skills of the staff are indeed apparent in every bite. The menu is expansive, with noodles, rice balls, bento boxes, entrees, and more in addition to sushi selections. \n\nThe house sake is good quality at a great price. We have eaten here several times and tried various sushi orders, rice balls, bento boxes, and udon, in addition to appetizers including various seafood and seaweed salad and a beef tongue special. Everything has been consistently excellent. \n\nThe aesthetic is spare and a bit sterile, in keeping with what you might find in Japan. We have had efficient and courteous service in our experiences at Heisei. The kitchen does tend to get behind on busy nights; the servers have been apologetic about that, and we have found the food well worth the wait.",

The menu items are a little pricey, but I think it would be a deal to come at lunch time. We got a variety of rolls and the katsu curry. Everything was delicious! The customer service was also outstanding. We got our waters refilled, plates cleared promptly, and the chefs made sure we were okay. Definitely coming back with my friends to try the lunch specials!

The meat was appropriately thick and the breading was the right \"weight\" -- not too light, not too heavy. More critically, it wasn't soggy or overly oily. The sandwich itself is massive. We split it between the two of us and were full. I'd strongly recommend adding their bistro sauce to the tenderloin.\n\nAdditionally, we also got the fried green beans and buffalo chips. Both were pretty good, although I'd personally get the green beans over the chips.\n\nOverall, this is totally worth the (short) drive from Lafayette.",

We were there after a Purdue game and it was clear this was a \"place to be\" for those in the know (this place is not exactly close to the stadium). \n\nTC's is a \"common ground\" meeting place for folks of all kinds - we saw young hipster foodies and old-timer regulars; a group of guys kicking back with some beers and a girls-night-out birthday party in heels and high makeup;  an alternative couple with tattoos and piercings, and a buttoned-down family with young kids. Everyone was just there to enjoy the food and the place. \n\nThe best thing: These folks know how to season and cook a steak! We had the strip and the filet, each medium rare. The strip was miraculously medium rare from within a millimeter of the seared edge all the way through. Unbelievable. Maybe the best steak this seasoned steak eater has had any where, any time. The filet was super flavorful, also right to temperature. Not the most velvety I've ever had, but definitely the most flavorful. Also very much recommended: the sauteed mushrooms!\n\nThe wine selection is limited but we found something we liked. Our one critique seems to be common around here where there is an apparent preference for corn-fed beef, which we struggle to understand as well-aged Western beef fans. In the end it's a small matter - especially since these folks really know how to cook a steak!",

One thing to know about Thursday nights here - you will need a reservation. Yes, this small town restaurant is PACKED on Thursday nights, which happens to be the only night prime rib is on the menu. Interior and exterior aren't fancy, which can be misleading about the yummy food served inside! Tbh I've only had two menu items in the years I've been visiting - the pork chop and the prime rib. Both are absolutely delicious. Now the rolls and salad are ordinary but the berries are fantastic! If you still haven't been to TC's you're missing out!",

One side is more of a bar, and the other side a restaurant, but they are both open and there are tables on both sides.\nNow for the food. This is a steak and sandwiches kind of place. I got the grilled cheese with buffalo chips and coleslaw. Oh those buffalo chips! I split them with hubs and they were delicious. I'd definitely get the grilled cheese again. Everyone else loved their food too, which ranged from chicken to steak with fries) and the cheese curds and onion rings were tasty and the perfect amount for 4 hungry adults and a picky teenager.\nWe enjoyed our meals and the service so much that we started thinking of other things to do in this area so we can all eat here again!",

My wife looked on On Yelp for a place to have lunch and came across TC's. Caroline was our server (and she was beyond excellent) and every single expectation for a family of 5 to get a decent lunch was far exceeded... The food was delicious, the restaurant was neat and clean and we received quite possibly the best service we have ever received at ANY restaurant (high-end or otherwise). I'd like to brag again on Caroline and say that I wish every business had team members like her. She made us feel completely at home, did more for us than any server we've ever had had done and had a genuine smile on her face the entire time. Listening to her and the other staff interact with the other guests assured us that this wasn't an isolated incident... this is a TC way of life. Thanks for everything!",

It was recommended to us by a local and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe tried both the breaded tenderloin and the BLT. The tenderloin was huge! It had a nice balance to sandwich. It was not chewy or overly moist, but just the right amount of both. My coworker got the side salad and it was your standard side salad. \n\nThe BLT was very tasty and had a good proportion of ingredients. The bacon was crispy and on the thicker side. I really liked the buffalo chips, which were like flattened Arby's curly fries in their flavoring and they had a good crunch to them.\n\nThe place was packed when we got in there for a late lunch. It seemed like somewhere the locals hang out a lot. Good place if you are every in the Battleground, IN area. \n\nThey have a daily special that is $6.50 and it seemed like everyone but us was getting the chicken and noodles that are the Wednesday special.",

I was lost and cruising the Indiana countryside on a trip back from Chicago.  I hit this little country restaurant and bar about 4 PM on a weekday, with already 30 or 40 cars in the parking lot.  \n\nMore out of curiosity than hunger or thirst, I stopped in to see what the fuss was about. Before I knew it, I was watching these gargantuan meals come out of the kitchen from my barstool perch: huge steaks, massive cheeseburgers, even massive salads, accompanied by a LOT of smiles when the plates were laid down. \n\nI ordered a fried pork tenderloin sandwich, an Indiana state dish if there ever was one. What came out was a tenderloin the size of my plate (see photo). And my plate was a full dinner plate, which was completely covered by the Paul Bunyan-esque sandwich. \n\nNow that I'm reading the other reviews of TC's, it's clear that all their food is oversized, well-prepared and relatively inexpensive.  By the time I left at 530, the place was jammed up, completely packed, and loaded with laughter and good conversation. \n\nI'm going back to this little gem of a throwback Indiana pub and restaurant on my next trip to Chicago, and I'll make sure to order a steak or a cheeseburger, which looked good, as did everything else.  And Craig the burly bartender will remember me, as he was duly impressed that I ate every single morsel of my Andre the Giant Tenderloin. And a small plate of shrooms.",

The BBQ sauce was nice...not overpowering but added a nice taste without being dripping wet.\n\nThe Caesar salad pizza was very innovative.  The Caesar salad was fresh.  The dressing was much like you expect.  The amount was just right to give the salad taste without ruining it.  The cheesy bread underneath was outstanding.  The bread was soft and the cheese was delicious!\n\nThe Caprita pizza was also delicious.  The tomato sauce was light with a slightly spicy taste.  It had a mild tomato taste that was much more mild than a normal marinara sauce.  The toppings very light but fresh and tasty.  The balsamic glaze was strong in taste but had a wonderful accept to the cheese, sauce and veggies.\n\nI was disappointed that the fountain soda machine was out of service.  They gave me a bottled Diet Coke from the cooler. I had to ask for a cup and ice because the bottle was warm..and the soda was very flat.\n\nOverall...I really liked Lotsa.  Give it a try!",

      "text": "Pizza on Purdue's campus is absolutely nothing to write home about. Sure, I'm an IU grad so I'm biased but outside of Mad Mushroom, you really don't have options. At all. So when my friend and I visited 2 years after gradating, we were amazed to se an addition to West Lafayette in Lotsa Pizza.\n\nThe name might need help, but the pizza definitely doesn't. While we had our sights set on a food tour, we knew we wanted pizza so we kept it light, splitting one pizza to save room for dessert. I have a policy with new places- KISS. Never experiment, and always veer towards a margherita-esque option to judge fairly. The same rules applied here.\n\nCurrent Boilermakers are pampered with this pizza: with a wood-fired crust that reminds me of MOD in Indianapolis, this pizza is the veritable opposite of the Merriam-Webster definition of 'college pizza.' It's well-crafted, unique, balanced, and NOT over-indulgent.\n\nSure, it won't cut it when you're hungover, but that's what Mad Mush cheesestix are for. This is a pizza you can build into your life in regular intervals and proportions without risking the Freshmen 15.",

      "text": "For my recent birthday, I chose Lotsa Pizza so that my family could select their own pizzas and know that they are safe since Lotsa offers gluten-free crusts. (The four of us all have Celiac Disease.)\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nThe wait to order our pizza was long even though there were not that many people in line. The employees seemed overmatched. But that was not the worst part of our experience.\n\nI made it clear to the employee taking our order that all four us were gluten-free due to allergy. For some reason, he only wrote Allergy on three of the sheets that accompany the pies. He made my older son's pizza on regular crust.\n\nFortunately, the guy who puts the pies in the oven discovered the error and they remade the pizza. However, that was not communicated to us and when I went back to ask what was being done, I was completely ignored even though I was two feet away and politely saying, \"Excuse me\" to get his attention. Finally, another employee had the courage to make eye contact and assured me that he was remaking the pizza.\n\nStill because of the time to remake the pizza, other pizzas with gluten crusts were put in the oven. That potential cross-contamination could be the reason that my son felt sick after eating.\n\nLotsa reasons to never return to this place.\n\nEdit: Since I cannot reply directly to the owner's comment, I will do do here. No, sir, I do not want your offer of free pizza. Your employees made two of my family members sick because of negligence. As I said, we will not be back.",

Prices here are great, gluten free crust available, menu has original flavors, and place has plenty of space for large groups but wish there was more informative pricing on adding toppings for a custom pie. I'd like to see other sizes available too since a group having to order their own personal pizzas each gets really hassled and frustrating trying to make each person pick a topping and hope they all eat everything. That's obviously getting very picky. Only real issues are limited and awkward parking especially on busy weekends and watching the nice people try to handle the sardines (c'mon guys it's a great salty addition completely transformed in flavor when it gets on pizza.... OK might still be just for me but I'm all about that option here! few other spots in the whole city offer sardines on pizza).",

I love these types of places, and I'm glad to see West Lafayette finally has a good make your own pizza venue. Also, for it to be located on campus is a dream come true. \n\nIf you've never been to one of these places before, the process is fairly simple - you pick a pizza dough, a type of sauce, your cheese, and toppings. They then fire the pizza in the oven for a few minutes. All pizzas are personal sized. Once pulled out of the oven, you can then add a finishing sauce/ingredient. (Such as olive oil, ranch, arugula, etc.)\n\nI happen to honestly really enjoy this location. Other make your own pizza places tend to have very thin crust in my experience, but Lotsa's dough tends to have more volume and is a nice compromise between super thick crust (which would probably take longer to cook properly) and paper thin crust (which ends up tasting like a cracker). \n\nThe selection of toppings is more than sufficient, and you can get pretty creative. I'm a big fan of Hawaiian pizzas, so I typically order red sauce with ham, pineapple, and ricotta cheese. Sometimes I do mushrooms instead. It's good no matter what! I've never found myself needing a finisher, but I may have to try the pesto someday.\n\nIt's an incredibly filling meal for the price you pay. For a make your own, prices run at $8 unless you add a premium topping such as shrimp. Compared to some of the other prices on campus, this is incredibly reasonable. If you weren't particularly hungry, and were just looking for a small bite to eat, I could even see sharing one of these between two people - it's a good amount of food.\n\nLotsa stays open late some nights, which is definitely nice if you're looking for a late night meal. I've only gone for lunch before, however.\n\nThe interior is clean and modern, and there is a good amount of seating. \n\nOverall, I am so glad to have Lotsa as an option on campus. I will definitely be returning this upcoming semester!",

I was shocked to walk into a nicely decorated restaurant with table service. \n\nThe lunch sushi rolls are named after buildings on campus and I had the Hall of Music roll (spicy crab roll) and the Stewart roll (spicy tuna) and they were both really good. They also have many Korean dishes such as bibimbap, Korean fried chicken, gamja tang, etc. Food arrived quickly so people on their lunch hour could easily have enough time for lunch.",

I ordered the bibimbap in a stone bowl, which allowed me to scrape the bottom for those crunchy bits of rice. However, the flavor was a bit lacking in my opinion. The complimentary miso soup was a surprise on a chilly day, and also quite tasty. I look forward to trying this place again!",

There was corn in it which gave it a distinct flavor. \nMy husband said Yummytime has better bulgogi per meat and juiciness ratio.\nBut for sushi.

      "text": "This review is for the food and the service provided during this Covid-19 issue. \n\nWe ordered from Hunter's using their online order form that we found on their FB page. The ordering process was very simple and a full menu, as well as beer, is available.  The order form gives you the opportunity to customize your sandwiches.  For example \"sauce on the side\" is an option.  \n\nWe ordered the pub chicken sandwich with chips and the High 5 grilled cheese with waffle fries.   My wife got her sauce on the side and I was able to remove the provolone cheese and add bacon. We ordered and the website told us our order would be ready in 15 minutes and gave the instructions on how to pick up.  We arrived at the 15 minute mark, called to let them know we were there, and they brought our order right out. \n\nWe drove to a local park to eat and our food was still hot and good as always!\n\nHunter's has done a good job of adjusting for the current situation.",

I missed their darling nachos grande so we decided to order some for take out and Hunter's did several things right. They not only had the food warm and ready for us to pick up, they packed moist towelettes, napkins, plasticware, and did not skimp out on the food. The amount was as much as we would have if eating in. They seemed really appreciative of our support for their local business.",

      "text": "Decided to try this place out with my BF for some good take out after cooking at home for awhile and to support local businesses. This was our first time and we were looking forward to trying it out. The lady who took our order was very nice and the food was ready in less than 15 minutes. Then we checked our order and found out our half-pound, $11 boneless chicken appetizer only had 10 small chicken pieces. Maybe they were half a pound but I don't think so. We asked the lady and she said that it's always 10 wings to a order so I don't understand why they can't just write that on the menu instead of \"half-pound\" of chicken as it's misleading. The burger and fries were pretty good so I didn't want to review them low due to how good service was and the food was not bad. Just very disappointed by the chicken as it was an appetizer that didn't come with any additional sides besides celery.",

The Cesar salad was less then good due to the amount of water in it . The tenderloin was over cooked  and waffle fries . The prime rib sandwich was ok .. and had to feed 2 of us to make up for the bad steak . \nI called the place back to explain the problems and even sent a text to show him the pic and was only offered 2 -$5 gift cards for the next visit . ( even though the dinner was $19.99)  the baked potato was also old and brown . Very disappointed in the results and spending $45 on poor food .",

      "text": "I've now been here three times, and I feel like I can give them a solid 4 stars.  We discovered that if you sit on the left side of the self-seat restaurant, it's the \"drinking\" area, so the waitstaff doesn't see you.  We ended up leaving in a hungry huff, but later realized it was kind of on us.  That said, the restaurant probably should've noticed that two people were sitting there with no drinks and looking around....or put up a sign that says \"Bar service this way, restaurant service that way.\"  I took off half a star for this mix up.\n\nThe second and third times were solid.  I got the same dish both times, and was pleased with the portion size; I walked out super full.  The onion rings are large and battered, which I appreciate more that the crumb coating.  The chicken parm sandwich was yummy.  Spouse had a hamburger the first time, and a frisco melt the second time. In his words, 'They're okay, dawg.\"  Which, translated, means, \"They were okay, but not so good that I won't try something else next time.\"\n\nThe other half star was taken off because of the way they label their bathrooms.  The men's room is labeled \"Hunter,\" and the women's room is labeled \"Hunted.\"  We live in a post-#MeToo era, and this seems pretty tone-deaf.  I don't really want a bar reminding me that it's a place where I could be \"hunted\" by their other clientele.",

      "text": "Hunters is a mixed bag for me, but I think four stairs is fair based on overall food quality, value, beer/food selection, and furnishings. I've been here six or eight times over the years and decided to finally write a review. \n\nI had the black-n-blue burger, well done, with fries. The burger was cooked through without being burnt. The blue cheese was sharp and added good taste and texture. Lettuce and tomato garnish was super fresh. The bun was nothing spectacular, it did not hold up to the weight of the burger or my cutting the sandwich, but did its job and held the burger and toppings together. The fries were a disappointment. These were overcooked and lukewarm. Definitely had been sitting in the fry pile for a while and dried out. There is no excuse for a pub not serving fresh piping hot fries. A disappointment that should drop this review to three stars, but the quality of the second meal buoyed my score.\n\nMy partner had the chicken quesadilla dinner plate, which came with refried beans, rice, some lettuce and sour cream, and a side of salsa too spicy to eat. Very good dish and we had enough quesadilla left for a take home snack. The entire place seemed to be staffed with one bartender and two servers. They kept up with the full house remarkably well. Overall a good value for the price, both meals under $10. My partner got the usual overpriced soda but the server kept it full.\n\nThis pub draws mostly graduate students and the 40-65 year old crowd, local professionals and married folk on a dates or girls night out. There are exceptions, both younger and older, but it's definitely not a college bar. Hunters is a decent pub that benefits from its location, large menu, and lack of competition in this busy commuter corridor loaded with strip-mall and small businesses. The interior is nothing special: a lot of wood, TVs, and chalkboard signage. It's quite boring actually but the pre-geriatric crowd doesn't seem fazed in the slightest.\n\nI'm not a fan, as four stars suggests, but Hunters is a safe bet. Hard to go wrong with this local establishment. Final verdict: 3.5 stars and I'm rounding up due to value. Give me hot fresh fries, and it's four stars fo realz, yo!",

My fiancé and I love to come here for special occasion date nights and we always tell people that it is one of our favorite restaurants ever. We talked about it so much that our families joined us for a meal for a celebration we were having. They all enjoyed the food as well! My family is from out of town, and they were raving about their meal and how they couldn't wait to go back. They still talk about how good the food was! We always joke that we would make the 3 hour drive just for La Scala's food! It's that good!! I seriously cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I've only ever dined inside, and the atmosphere is really nice. It's quiet, intimate, and cozy. I would love to dine outside as well though! They have a really pretty patio area with lights. I can't wait to go back soon! I would also like to add that I am gluten free and they have great options for me, including gluten free dinner rolls!",

      "text": "Thank goodness for La Scala! As a born-and-raised Chicago girl, I require a higher than normal amount of cheese and carbs for daily survival (preferably in the form of pizza, but pasta will also suffice). I admit that I was a bit worried about finding good Italian food after moving to Indiana...but not anymore!\n\nWhen you walk in the door of La Scala, the first thing that hits you is the ambiance. Like Pavlov's dogs, I've been conditioned to salivate when I hear the crooning voice of Sinatra, especially when combined with the smell of garlic in the air. Add in the warm and cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and ample seating (indoor and out, weather permitting), and I was in heaven. I loooove their menu; I seriously have a list of about 10 items still to try, and had a lot of difficulty choosing which one to start with. Everything sounds SO good! On my first trip I had the pumpkin mac & cheese, with their apple cider cocktail drink. So much comfort food. It's like a hug on a plate! \n\nIf you are looking for a great place to get that homecooked meal even if you're far from home, give La Scala a try. They're open for lunch and for dinner (they do close in between though, so be wary if you're looking for something between 2-5). They cater to special food restrictions, including gluten-free, so get on in there and eat!",

Now there are far and few dishes that I can enjoy at an Italian restaurant. Not anymore! La Scala is now my go-to place in Lafayette for gluten free pasta!\n\nFirst of all, I love this building! Gothic archway and stained glass on the front entryway. Lovely outdoor seating area with the rustic charm of Italy itself. Did I also mention that they are farm to table and chef-owned? Yep, everything you could ever want to support in a local restaurant is here at La Scala!\n\nI came here with some friends, and everyone LOVED their entrees and drinks. Definitely Try their lasagna. It's fresh, homemade and amazing! You also get your money's worth here. I couldn't finish all of my food, even though I wanted to. The server was very knowledgeable in what items were gluten-free, and if he didn't know he would go and ask the chef. Superb customer service. I can't wait for my next trip to Lafayette so I can sample more of what they have to offer for us gluten intolerant folks.",

      "text": "My best friend has raved about this place for years, but we had never tried it, so when we were picking a place to have a slightly belated Valentine's Day dinner (February 15th), I figured it was time to finally try La Scala.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate. I wouldn't really recommend it for groups. There are a few four seater tables, but it looked like most of the tables were for two. However, the tables are very close together (very European style), so if you're looking for a quiet place where you won't hear the conversations of people around you, this may not be the place for you. It wasn't too bad for us, although my chair was touching the chair of the woman behind me. The tables were lovely, set with white tablecloths and tea lights.\n\nThe meal starts with water an bread service. The bread does come with olive oil and spices for dipping (yum!), but the bread has olives in it, so if you're not an olive fan, be aware. You can pick most of them out if you want to though.\n\nWe didn't get any appetizers, though the shrimp and crab dip sounded really good (and then the table next to us ordered it, and it looked delicious, but my husband would never eat it and it was definitely too much for me!). I was torn between the seafood ravioli and the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese; our server recommended the mac and cheese, so that's what I went with. My husband ordered the pollo ripieno without the red pepper cream sauce.\n\nMy husband said his dish was very flavorful, even without the sauce. I absolutely LOVED the mac and cheese. The Grand Marnier cream sauce was lovely, the mozzarella on top was extra melty, and I thought the orange was a thoughtful (and tasty) touch. There was also way more seafood than I expected; there were whole shrimp, large chunks of lobster, and it seemed to be almost as much seafood as pasta!\n\nUnfortunately, we had to cut our evening short (our babysitter called to say our youngest had gotten sick), but our server, Beau, was awesome about getting us the check quickly, boxing up the rest of my meal (I don't think I'd ever had someone else box up my leftovers for me before!), and getting me a cannoli to go (the cannoli was delicious, btw -- very smooth filling!).\n\nGreat food and great service makes La Scala a great choice!",

This might not seem like a typical lunch spot, but it is tasty and affordable...with options other than pasta. I had a cup of chicken vegetable soup and a Ceaser salad with bread, all for about $10. Local, fresh, friendly service and different. My friend had  an Italian veggie sandwich that she loved. Certainly worth supporting a great local restaurant.",

I think dinner will be more dressy than casual. \n\nRustic wood tables and upholstered chairs. \n\nAlong with the pasta, sandwiches were on the menu. They looked good. \n\nI had the Ravioli Florentine in cream sauce sun-dried tomatoes and spinach. \n\nA small salad of field greens cucumber and carrots dressed in homemade balsamic vinaigrette came first.  Very tasty. \n\nWith the ravioli a homemade personal loaf of herbed bread was served. Soft and fluffy with a crispy bottom. Mmm. \n\nMeal finished for under $17 with tip, no alcohol. \n\nI will return. \n\nThe one problem is the parking. It is downtown Lafayette with street parking",

He answered all of my questions regarding the menu, he brought multiple samples of wine and even suggested his favs. Everything was to my liking and when the food finally came it was piping hot and delicious! The calamari was fresh and crispy. My white broccoli and cheddar soup was so good my friends sent their salads back and requested the soup togo. I'm definitely a \"eat in bed\" kind of girl so I took majority of my food togo so i coild eat it in bed . it was literally so good I couldn't enjoy it in a restaurant, it's definitely a comfort meal so i needed to be comfy. The Restaurant had low lights and soft music playing the vibe was LOVELY! Also there was lots of nice artwork hanging all throughout the restaurant. I'd definitely recommend. Ask for \"Bow\" or \"Beau\"",

      "text": "Along with Red Seven and Bistro 501, this has to be one of the most well-to-do places in downtown Lafayette. I suggest getting your special event reservations for this place too a few months early.\n\nVery classic Italian in both aesthetic, ambiance, and food. It's really cute inside, with the art, brick, and dark wood. Though the dining rooms are quite narrow, the high ceilings make up for it and the setting is actually quite intimate. Like Red Seven, the ambiance is quite flexible. You can go there casually with friends, but also on a date or professionally. It does feel a little more mature, classier, or kind of meant for older people, but you definitely get plenty of college students cycling through. On warmer nights, they also have the enclosed outdoor seating with fairy lights, and on warm nights it is its own kind of beautiful.\n\nIf you want something light, get something with the lemon sauce and pair it with their limoncello. However, my favorite is anything with the wine cream sauce. But ingredients are fresh, the pasta is handmade, and they really have something for everyone. Actually, honestly there isn't anything here I don't like. At the end of the meal, I like to have one of their desserts. Tiramisu (which is apparently imported) for dessert if you want to have something absolutely gorgeous at the end. The cannoli is good too, but you can get an equally delicious one at Vienna (coffee shop) for cheaper. They have different kinds of the fresh bread on different days, though I'm not sure of the scheduling a the moment.\n\nThe wait staff are WONDERFUL. In my rush, I once forgot my credit card at La Scala, and they held onto it for me until I got it back. Even better, they verified my identity before doing it, which I appreciate. Also, I had this one incident with some friends and their family where the numbers kept shifting (some people got stuck in traffic) and we sat down to eat and then they came, and then some didn't--the point is that the staff were SUPER accommodating. Not to mention they just rolled with whatever kind of diet the people I brought/with threw at them.\n\nFor a smaller taste, check them out at the downtown food festival Lafayette holds every summer. They almost always have a booth there. Best bet is to park in the garage behind Red Seven. From there, take the doors into the bank offices (I've never actually seen them lock), and walk out through the lobby. It'll place you smack dab on the street corner where you just cross the street and you're pretty much there.",

We were with our freshman who would not have appreciated the deliciousness inside so we went elsewhere. We were going to be here for two more nights. Closed Sunday but went back Monday night. It was again quite busy. The very friendly host found us a table outside and since they were short on staff waited on us himself. \n\nThe bread was a nice treat to start. I had the beef canneloni. I love that they use local ingredients including the beef. The tricolor pasta sheets were a thing to behold. I did not waste a bite of this dish. There is so much that I wanted to try on that menu I'm sure I'll get something different next time but maybe not. Loved sitting outside in the courtyard.",
