The Reuben is so good, they really stack the sauerkraut on there, and there is plenty of meat as well. The ciabatta roll was perfection, a little crunchy but soft and chewy on the inside. I will definitely be stopping by again, just wish it wasn't on the other side of town because it's the perfect quick lunch spot.",

I live in Seattle and was planning on visiting to celebrate birthdays with my parents who are turningg 92 and 94. COVID-19 changed my plans. I ordered  from Homestead via Grubhub since I couldn't travel to take my parents to dinner. Unfortunately Grubhub never showed up. When I called Homestead to explain the situation the manager of the West Lafayette store, Michelle stepped in. It was a Grubhub failure, in no way Homestead's fault.  That wasn't good enough for Michelle. After her long day at work Michelle called me to say she was going to personally deliver a meal to my parents, on her own time, in her personal vehicle. We are all facing a terrible situation with COVID, but this is a business managed by an individual with heart,  who cares about her customers on a personal.level. Also at her own expense, Michelle even brought flowers and a card when she delivered the meal (I didn't ask for that she just took it upon herself to do it). If I still lived in West Lafayette my family would be eating at Homestead every week. You will love the food, but even more importantly this is a business with heart. Thank you Michelle!!!",

I almost don't want to recommend the frosted cutout cookies for fear I will come to buy them and they will be sold out.

I got the patemsan crusted Cod special with coconut corn & pineapple salsa and it was stellar! It was so good I forgot to take a picture at first. My hubby got the rib basket and it was just great comfort food like always! \nI had a horrible migraine and they allowed me to come in without a mask. My hubby wore one as required but I appreciate their willingness to allow me that mask exemption. \nThey have a great side parking lot for parking.",

      "text": "Disappointing overall.\n  So many good reviews but not what we experienced.\nIn fact, this was the most disappointing meal we've had in Lafayette.\nThe ribs were DRY - how do you dry out fatty pork ribs?  The taste was ok but they were almost inedible.\nThe Shrimp & Grits were terrible.  The grits were solid at room temperature, they use cheap shrimp which were over cooked, rubbery, and poorly seasoned.  The brown sauce/gravy on this dish was the only thing that saved it.\nThe Pork Belly egg rolls were very good, the drinks were also good, but the delivery was VERY slow.. \n We could hear and see the martinis being shaken and then watched them sit  on the bar for several minutes.\n Same suspected for the food, based on the condition at the table, it had probably been sitting a while.\n  We were so disappointed that we didn't order dessert and we didn't take our leftover food to the dogs. Such a shame.\n I hate to see a small town restaurant get a bad review, but considering it was our worst meal yet, it's within walking distance of our house and we won't probably be going back, they need to address these issues.",

      "text": "We enjoyed our dinner tremendously . Fabulous food. Our server was a little Pompous which rubbed us just a little the wrong way telling us each entree how exactly the chef would make it with no exceptions. Example - said certain steak entree the chef would only prepare it medium rare or medium. I asked \"what if I wanted it medium well?\" And the answer was NO. I get it but there were several entrees like this presented to us how we could or could not have it. Ever heard of customer is always right? Outside of this slight pickiness the vibe was good and we loved the food just turn down the pompous deal a tad and it will be 100%. Will return and please known we did like our experience",

      "text": "On our way back from Chicago to Indy we were craving a continuation of the fabulous food of the city and decided to veer into Lafayette for a peek at the options. We ended up at East End Grill and immediate lived the interior, the friendly welcome and the menu options. The warm wood finishing a amid the steel helped with noise reduction and the variety of tables gave us an option near the window to enjoy the sunshine.\n\nOur server was fabulous and explained several of the options even going so far as to consult with the kitchen as to how to turn some of the dishes vegan. Her sunny disposition and ease of service was a nice balm after the drive.\n\nThe mead spritzer I tried (we abandoned the vegan for vegetarian to try the mead) was delightful and refreshing. I loved the crispness and tart aftertaste.\n\nHowever the delight was the Brussels sprouts appetizer with a hint of smoky flavor, perfect char on the veggies and a liberal portion of perfectly flavored hummus. This starter was a signal of the flavors to come, as my beet and arugula salad with orange, pepitas and balsamic was so fresh with sweetness and acid mixing perfectly. Then came the amazing, oh so perfect gnocchi. It was a butternut squash base which literally melted in your mouth with such depth of flavor I couldn't stop eating! The additions of capers, spinach and crispy crunch on the toppings just made the dish delightful. I have only had gnocchi this good one other time, and this lives in my tastebuds and dreams. Yum!!\n\nWe are already talking about when we will come back as this flavor is worth the drive! Plus an added bonus was a visit from the manager to say hi and check in on us. So amazing! If you haven't been then head on over as East End Grill is not to be missed!",

Josh was our attentive server who enthusiastically informed us that the restaurant makes everything from scratch with fresh ingredients. We decided to have a rather light lunch that we shared consisting of a delicious crab cake, side salad, and the house cut truffle fries with a garlic sauce that stole the show. Crisp, lightly flavored with truffle oil, and dusted with Parmesan cheese....these fries were the best I've had in many years and I consider myself a fry connoisseur. If you find yourself in downtown West Lafayette, make a point of stopping by this restaurant for the fries and friendly service.",

FOOD. \n\n1/5 stars. The best thing we ate, was the truffle fries. And honestly if we got those to go and didn't eat anything else or if we weren't served, this would be a higher rated review. \nThose fries though...I would come back just for those. Hat is off to them for those god sends. \n\nWe also ordered a salmon burger and a cheese burger. Both were terrible and we didn't even eat them. \n\nService. -5/5 stars. Our server changed several times. I don't even know if we had a server. Maybe we came during a shift change, but nevertheless at the most, we should have had at max 2 servers. We had at least half a dozen. Step that up.\n\nAll in all, order a to go order of Truffle Fries, go inside to look at the beautifulness and leave.",

The food is just not good enough to be worthy of it becoming a favorite. Ribeyes are normally tender, mine wasn't. The add-on \"mushrooms and onions\" was 95% onions. Our server was very busy and I watched my beer sit at the bar for about 10 minutes...and most aggravating, I watched the bartender use a swizzle stick to stir up a head on it after it had dissipated. That's just tacky.  Prices are reasonable - maybe raise your steak prices a little and buy better beef?  A little effort is all it takes to go from meh to good in this case.",

Steak was prepared a perfect medium, and the sea bass was flaky enough to not use a fork.  We split a delicious crepe brûlée for dessert.  It's not the least expensive restaurant in town, but we'll definitely be back to try more of the menu.",

Our server was Tony, nothing short of amazing! He was funny kept the drinks coming, just an all around awesome server! The Calamari was BOMB!!! It was seasoned so well and fried perfectly, I could've ordered three more. My steak was a bit on the rare side but again tony was so great I couldn't complain. The steak was also a bit chewy, I wasn't a fan. My friend loved her burger and fries, she stated the pretzel bun was so soft and it didn't taste like a pretzel (she doesn't like pretzels) and even though the burger was cooked well done she said it was still soooo juicy! My other friend didn't quite like the crab cake (more cake than crab) we're lump crab cake eaters and it wasn't lump. The meal wasn't perfect but the experience was really really nice. I really enjoyed my birthday Thank you Tony!!!",

      "text": "I am remiss in not writing a review here a LONG time ago... We have been coming here since the late 80's when students at Purdue and it was Stiney's with the boat out front... \n\nThere are many steak / seafood places in Central Indiana, but there are very few with the attention to food selection and preparation detail as McGraw's. From simply amazing cuts of beef like an amazing filet, ribeye and more (do not pass up the horseradish sauce that accompanies the ribeye). There is also a special cut off of a ribeye that is simply my go-to but is not on the menu. The catfish is just the same as Stiney's used to serve and a true calling card for this estabishment. The chef also brings in from time to time some of the best oysters from around the country and they DO NOT dissapoint (he was previously at a seafood place in LAF that had the best oysters in Central IN). Great appetizers as well with the Firecracker shrimp highly recommended. \n\nWe are here often and it is a bit like our Cheers of Greater Lafayette. We haven't made a reservation in years and prefer to find a seat at the bar or one of the few bar-side tables. It has a casual vibe and is not pretentious, yet guests in jeans or their dress finest are both seen here nightly. The bar service is one of the best around as well, and Mike the head bar-keep knows what we want as soon as he sees us and never misses the mark. It is normal to see the owner most every night and he clears tables and pitches in no matter if he is in jeans or a tie. It is clear he treats his staff well, and the longevity of them speaks volumes. \n\nYes we are very partial to McGraw's and yes we frequent it often. It is truly our type of place and there is no better place for us to spend an evening together for dinner or to just grab a drink and enjoy ourselves.",

In West Lafayette, IN, the top choices included Logan's roadhouse, Outback and Mountain Jacks. McGraws sounded right in my wheelhouse but some of the reviews made me nervous. I went anyway and was extremely pleased. It has a nice ambience, the service was just right and the food was excellent.",

      "text": "I've heard many of my friends talk about McGraw's as one of the nicer restaurants in the Lafayette area, so my boyfriend and I decided to go there for dinner on the night before Valentine's Day.\n\nIf you have not been here before, I recommend using a GPS so you don't miss the turn into the restaurant, especially if you have a late night dinner reservation.\n\nThe restaurant interior is very nice. It has a very home-y feel. The bar is situated in the front of the restaurant, and towards the back is a nice dining area where windows are so you can see the view of the Wabash River.\n\nWe ordered two appetizers, the smoked salmon on wonton skins, and the calamari. They both came out very quickly, much to our surprise. The smoked salmon was very good, although I think that it was a bit difficult to eat as the crispy wonton skins would break apart as soon as you took the first bite. My favorite appetizer, however, was the calamari. It is quite a large plate, enough for two or even three people to share, but it was so good we ate the whole plate! The sweet and spicy sauce that comes with the calamari is also an excellent complement with the dish.\n\nNot much longer after we finished devouring our appetizers, we got our entrees. I had ordered the ahi tuna dish, medium rare, that comes black pepper crusted atop a bed of spinach and slices of avocados. My boyfriend had ordered the ribeye steak, medium rare.\n\nThe tuna was cooked well, and tasted fresh to my surprise. My sides were linguini and steak cut fries. The linguini didn't have very much tomato sauce (which I enjoyed since I do not care for much sauce with my noodles), and the steak fries were crispy and not very oily like most fries tend to be.\n\nThe next time I go, however, I will order the ribeye. The few bites of the ribeye that I sampled were absolutely divine. The meat was a very good cut, tender, and had been seasoned and marinated well.\n\nYou would think that we were full after finishing al of our food, but in fact, we ordered two desserts! The chocolate lava cake and the raspberry cheesecake. We took them to go since the restaurant had closed, but even at home we were able to enjoy both desserts. Leave room for dessert, they are delicious!\n\nFor all the food we got (2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and 2 desserts), the total came to a little over $100, but for the quality of the food, service, and of course, the occasion, I was extremely satisfied.\n\nI definitely would recommend this place to anyone celebrating any occasion, graduations, anniversaries, birthdays, or even just to treat themselves!\n\nOh, and on the way out, there is a step. Do not be fooled. There is a small sign, but you will be so full and wanting to sit down in the car and digest that you won't even notice it. I almost fell, but if I did fall, I would have fallen a happy customer.",

The so called \"American Wagyu\" beef is probably raised in some random farm middle of the cornfields with no significant difference to the ones from Walmart.\nThe worst was yet to come. The spaghetti was so tangled up it was as thick as my index finger. The portions made me wonder if I have ordered from the kids menu... giving portions that match Michelin three star doesn't mean it make it so.\nOne star for the setup\none star for being an Purdue student\nOne star for fixing us with a new plate, which showed that they could do better\nThat's just about the limit of my generosity.",

Loved the ambience - not too noisy, mood lighting, decor is gorgeous! The bar and restaurant area are separate. There is also a place to to grab coffee/snacks if that's all you're in the mood for.\n\nWe tried the following from their dinner menu:\n1) Burrata Cheese with apricot mostarda, truffle honey, marcona almond, grilled rustic bread. The combination of the cheese + apricot is delicious!\n2) Shoestring fries\n3) Wild Mushroom Bolognese - I really enjoyed this dish. Not usually one to go for pasta, but this was definitely worth it. Very flavourful. \n4) Mille feuille - very tasty. The pastry was a little drier than what I'm used to, but I'd still recommend it. \n\nPortions are good. We shared the above between two people. \n\nThe only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there aren't a lot (if at all any) vegetarian or vegan options on the menu, except for some salad and side items.",

      "text": "I post a 4 star review with several service related concerns. I'm sure those will be addressed before my next visit. We were seated and remained at an empty table for roughly 10 minutes. When the sever arrived she explained that she hadn't been told she was seated. The other servers and manager need to be aware of the entire dining room experience. After a lengthy apology with many excuses, we ordered drinks and asked for glasses for the water bottle she had brought to the table. Sometime later she returned to let us know the bar was backed up and our drinks would be out soon. We ordered an appetizer and again asked for water glasses. Sometime about 20 minutes after being seated, we received glasses for the water with another excuse that they were out of clean glassware. Of course the dozens of clean glasses sitting on the tables around us might have been a suitable alternative. No manager ever approached the table which meant they either weren't aware of the botched greeting process or didn't think it important to address the situation. Our drinks arrived and we settled into the experience. I had a simple martini. Presentation is 10/10. We shared the escargot. The dish was piping hot but the escargot was a bit chewy. Probably overcooked but the flavors were great. I had the seared salmon with lentils. The salmon was a perfect mid rare, lentils slightly mushy but good flavor. The server didn't suggest a starter. Another guest had the burger and said it was great. We requested dessert menus from the server. After checking out the options, we settled on the bread pudding. As we placed our order, she let us know that they were out of bread pudding. Hopefully a lesson learned: tell your guests you don't have certain items before leaving a menu on the table. We had the key lime pie which was great! I applaud the staff knowing that they are all in the hospitality program and learning as they are in the job. However, the prices don't reflect a learning environment rather a fine dining experience. Managers, if still in the learning process, need to do a better job of coaching and following up with the guests throughout. Looking forward to great food and improved service in the future.",

Our group of 5 was treated very well and took to all three menus. I noticed the prices for breakfast entrees and cocktails are downtown Chicago - not a $10.00 easy going fillup for either beverages or eggs! If this was a big city establishment, it would fit right in. With amazing morning egg spots offering more value like Town & Gown and Sacred Grounds, I'm sadly not sure I'll be here often despite the ideal menu options, designer interior, and delightful fare. They need a proper discount for local Purdue alumni! We all did a smattering of options from crepes, duck, and quinoa, couldn't complain about flavors or presentation. Can highly recommend the drinks and quinoa cakes were excellent. Thankfully the best value here is Leaps Coffee and their in house mixes. Ask what they're making! I'll have to save up and come back for a special day.",

      "text": "We had such a wonderful birthday experience at Revolution Barbeque! Lafayette can sometimes feel like it's lacking in good, solid restaurants that know what they're doing, but I can say, whole-heartedly, that Revolution Barbeque has all the knowledge.\n\nWe sat-in the restaurant, despite their booming carry out service, and enjoyed our time with all of the other patrons. For a Thursday night, they were surprisingly busy! There is a main dining area and then a craft bar area to the other side of a bricked wall. We opted for the bar area which had some dimmer lighting and a moodier ambience. We were immediately greeted by the bartender and my partner ordered a special bourbon cocktail. Whoever made their cocktail menu definitely knows what they're doing, because you'd have assumed you were in Chicago or Nashville. A bit pricey for Lafayette standards when you're staring at the menu, but just bite the bullet and order the drink, because they're well worth it. Beautiful presentation and such a nice experience. I would say Revolution Barbeque would be a nice place to come and just have a drink, but... how could you resist NOT eating something?\n\nThe food came and we were so impressed. We had actually ordered 3 sides between the two of us, however they mixed up our orders with another tables and made good by correcting our order and providing us with an overall total of 5 different sides to try out! We had the mustard greens, the Mac and cheese, the baked beans, the slaw, and the potato salad. Now, I am probably the pickiest eater under the sun, but I can tell you, whoever is cooking this food knows how to make a damn good side. The sides with the waffle corn bread were outstanding. I mean, straight out of the south. And, at a BBQ place? To rave about their sides? That's saying something. I had never had mustard greens and they were stellar and something I'd eat any day. The baked beans were out of this world. The Mac and cheese was amazing. I don't know what was in the corn bread, but I can say it's safe to say that it should be illegal, because I'm sure it's highly addictive. \n\nI am not a meat person at all, however the BBQ was so rich in flavor and so finely crafted. I never eat an entire sandwich and I can say I downed mine within a couple minutes. Granted, it comes with a lot of meat, so I pushed a bit to the side! Now I have leftovers for this evening's meal. \n\nSuch a nice experience for a birthday meal and such a nice addition to downtown Lafayette. They have the sweetest and funniest staff who help you pick everything you want, and they have incredible food with great drinks and a fun environment. If I could give 10 stars, I would.",

The burger had a very generous amount of toppings, and the bun was homemade. It was a great combination of flavors! We loved the sauce, tasted like strawberries on the front end and then hit you with the heat. We opted for the creamy slaw and potato salad as our sides. The slaw was crunchy and not too sweet or soupy. The potato salad had a great texture and flavor. \n\nService was quick and friendly. They had my order available to pickup in 10 minutes.",

The bar looks super cool too!\nWe started with Whiskey + Cherry Coke and Winter Sangria slushees, and they were amazing! Wonderful flavors and the consistency was perfect.\nFor dinner, we shared one of their platters -- the pulled pork, but we also added the brisket to it. We got sides of potato salad and Mac n cheese. The platter came with Texas toast as well. Everything was DELICIOUS. The brisket and pork were more traditional -- slices of brisket and roughly pulled pork, which we really liked. The Mac n cheese was also....incredible. \nThe meal came with four barbecue sauces -- the mustard and strawberry jalapeño were my favorites, and my husband was happy with their original. They also had a hot barbecue option!\nThe bartender was our server and he was very attentive, making sure that our needs were met throughout the meal. All in all, it was a great experience!",

      "text": "I want to share an experience to let you know the kind of people that own this business. Out front of the bar side door is a metal plate covering a chute the goes to the basement for deliveries. In September my family chose to go to Revolution for lunch. 5 of us. As we walked, my 70 year old mother hit the plate wrong and fell in to the chute, dropping 2 feet in to the ground, and seriously bruising her arm (which was x-rayed last month and STILL has a large lump under the skin). \n\nThe bartender cam running out, and SAW my mother in the whole. The street crew doing maintenance across the street also saw, and two pedestrians came running to help her. The bartender went to get the owner. There were 6 eye witnesses. \n\nThe female owner came out and looked at the plate and kept saying that \"she just didn't see how that could possibly happen,\" and kept insinuating that this was my mother's fault that their pitfall in THEIR property was not secured. I have included pictures of the plate that were taken later that week when you can see they were attempting to fix it. This was one of the days of outdoor dining downtown, and there are no cones or anything marking this hazard. \n\nUnbeknownst to this woman I WORKED in this same building when it was another restaurant, and it was always a concern someone would be hurt on this plate. One person had fallen in before. \n\nThe owner went about downplaying the incident, and saying she just didn't understand, and she would need to talk to her husband. We had to FORCE HER to take our number. \n\nHer husband never did show up. She never owned she was at fault (even after my mother said she would never press charges because her father had owned a small business). She didn't comp the lunch (which was marginal at best), she didn't comp half the lunch, she gave us three pieces of pie and never said another word. \n\nThey never called to express concern, or follow up. She could have sued Revolution and the city, but she didn't. Even after two injuries that could have been very serious had she completely gone down the keg chute. These are not good people. Do not give them your money. You can make BBQ just as good at home and not give a profit to unkind people.",

      "text": "Exquisite urban environment with lots of space and very family oriented staff. My buddy and I tried out Revolution for the first time this week and overall had decent things to say. Thankful that the prices don't take advantage but noticed that my buddy's order of ribs surprisingly made it out of the kichen, extremely fatty and lacking flavor, required a lot more digging and scraping then restaurant ribs I have become used to that rather fall off the bone with a few pokes and nibbles. Surprisingly Cheddar's comes to mind as some of the best ribs in the area. He should have ordered the pork or copied me for briscut! My 8oz was tender, nicely seasoned, soft enough, quite generous with the sides too unlike *cough* the new Ripple place nextdoor *cough* - I made the silly rookie mistake of saying beans for a side meaning the green beans but ended up with the basic beans. Would have been fine but the heavy beans along with my wonderful thick chili made for rich sides, filling n all but I'll do the slaw next time. I sampled the potato salad, rave reviews easy! The bar area is a splendid mix of classy and neat, great specialty slushies for the refined adult still trying to grow up. Of course I got the whiskey root beer! So good! Stuff of pool parties in fancy beach houses, a good size too, overall fitting well with the meats. Ended with an apple pie because they were out of banana cream (weeping), crust was very crusty and filling quite sweet, still easy to eat. Despite the weird turnout with the ribs, we both agreed we will have to come back and sample more of the menu to make sure the ribs were not just a fluke.",

Atmosphere is great! Lots of space in the building. Industrial feel and cool bar area. Menu is nice, with some delicious sounding appetizers and sides. I had the brisket taco, pork BBQ taco, Mac-n-cheese, and featured lemonade. Damn. The Mac-n-cheese was spot on. Tacos were very good, but I liked the pork one the best.\n\nSauces are tasty, but wanted more heat. Strawberry habanero is not spicy at all. My friend had the smoked chicken sandwich, sweet potato fries, and a bourbon pecan chocolate pie to go. She enjoyed her food. They make house buns for sandwiches! Overall, awesome experience.

If you're still hoping for a late night bite they feature \"bar snacks\" in the form of Tacos from 9-Midnight on Friday & Saturday. I've never had anything from here that I haven't liked and these tacos were fantastic. I ordered two, Mexican style (with pico and cheddar cheese), they hit the spot in the Goldilocks way- not too much, not too little, juuuust right. Service was friendly, accommodating to my questions and overall this is one of the best places in downtown!",

Wasn't sure when first looking at them as were pulling out of the bag but was pleasantly surprised. Everything tasted fresh and great flavor. Will say only downfalls we found was Mac and Cheese sides were really flavorless and tasted like plain noodles and the chocolate cake was very disappointing. Cheesecake was enjoyable though. \nWould definitely try again.",

And we will here, too. \n\nFirst off -- great customer service for takeout ordering. The woman taking our order was friendly and patient with questions. She was a bit unfamiliar with the menu, but we worked through it. And upon arrival, the food was ready and everything was there. So props for that. \n\nDo wish they had curbside pickup parking. Would make things much more convenient. \n\nFood wise -- the fried chicken and mashed potatoes with pepper gravy was really tasty. Five stars. And the coleslaw was really good, too. \n\nSadly, the rest of the meal was less exciting. Shrimp tacos had plenty of shrimp, but it was not at all seasoned. There was an almost laughably small amount of avocado on each taco. Boom boom sauce was good, but the pico de gallo was overwhelmingly jalapeño. And that dominated every bit. It was like just eating a jalapeño straight with no flavor complexity at all. \n\nSimilarly the jalapeño creamed corn (a fried chicken side) had no other flavor. The sweetness of the corn does not come through at all. Nothing but jalapeño. \n\nThe Mac and cheese was dry and flavorless. It seemed like it might have a spicy kick to it, too? Or maybe our mouths were just burned by other dishes. Hard to say.",

Food was ready in about 20 minutes. Wish they had curbside pickup. \nThe food itself was decent. The blackened tilapia sandwich was good, with the boom boom sauce, but the fish and fries was not my favorite. On top of that, they separated the fish rather than leaving it whole.

      "text": "A decent replacement for the favorite area burger house called Scotty's we had for many years at this location. Wolfies offers an enticing menu with good options however prices and food size are not as ideal as Scotty's offered despite the extensive beverage options, fantastic service, and accommodating atmosphere with a dirty monotone color pallet covering the ceiling and bricks all over the walls. Our best part was the bang bang shrimp app! Super tasty and perfectly made, follows by the lesser dishes, my ahi tacos and my friend's buffalo wrap. Both well thought out, presenting solid appetizing flavors and smells, but ultimately not serving up a massive win to keep us out of other near by places like Town & Gown, The Pint, or Red Seven. My buddy wasn't a fan of the powerful wasabi in my tacos even though I loved it exactly for that! We both agreed the Buffalo wraps were small for the price and oddly (unlike my wasabi treated tacos) lacked the bite buffalo should have. The sides were very nice, mac and cheese and coleslaw did us both well. Our drinks were also fine however my cucumber gin and tonic blew the doors off the desserts and everything else we got alongside our main dishes. Speaking of desserts, I completely forget either of our dishes except by the photos it looks like we tried the cookie and monkey bread. I seem to recall they were both average. Overall this feels like a grown up Buffalo Wild Wings! A few hits but would be better having a good group to enjoy the game, know the best dishes before hand, and figure out what will get us full before assuming $14 tacos is a packed dinner meal.",

I wish they would open a location in Indy!!\n\nThe Duane Purvis burger is a burger with peanut butter. Do not be closed minded about this and just TRY it if you think it sounds gross. It is the best, and they load the peanut butter on there!! Wanna make it even better? Be like me and add an egg on there. It will make your soul and tastebuds happy. Don't forget the root beer- always have to buy a six pack from them as well!\n\nThe inside of the restaurant is pretty small and cramped, but they have added outside seating tents for COVID. So if you like having a little elbow room, maybe try sitting outside. Never had bad service here either!",

That is a positive change.  \n\nThey have made several covid changes.  They have plexiglass around the countertops.  QR code's are how you get your menu.  They installed outdoor tent seating and require two seats between cust Owens at the counter.\n\nOn the down side...they still require you to stand in line to pay inside the building.  There is no room to social distance here.  The cashier takes phone orders which backs up the customers trying to pay.  I was also disappointed that the waitress didn't wipe down the condiments and salt & pepper shakers after we were finished.",

The wrapper was so soaked in grease, you could see the burger through the paper. That's a really good drive in burger. Had fries and a root beer with it.   If they served fried with the burger I would have given them 5 stars, but since the burger cost $10 without, they are getting only 4. \n\nA solid 4 bellies on my 5 belly scale.",

      "text": "I found Triple XXX by signing up for an Indiana tourism email with a link for 20 Destination Restaurants in Indiana. Also, Guy Fieri has visited Triple XXX on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives. There was plenty of intrigue.\n\nThe building is black and orange and the name very eye-catching if your mind is in the gutter. The name refers to the highest quality of root beer at what was once a thirst station found around the country in the early 20th century. Triple XXX is the last one standing and located very close to Purdue.\n\nI ordered something unusual for me...a root beer! But I felt like I had to order one from here and it didn't disappoint. I have hated root beer most of my life but it has grown on me with this being the best I have had.  It just seemed to have a more fresh flavor.  I also went with the root beer float thar contained real ice cream for a solid win.\n\nBesides root beer, Triple XXX is known for their burgers. Guy Fieri ate the Purvis which has peanut butter on it. That's not for me.  I went with Flash Gordon that had bacon, grilled onions, jalepenos, American cheese, jalepeno ketchup, and 4 sirloin patties!  The patties looked like McDonald's patties but they had a better quality of taste to them.  The menu states they put the meat in flour before cooking.  Curly fries were the perfect accompaniment. \n\nOne destination restaurant down in Indiana and more to go!",

Bill was a very reasonably inexpensive $44.14 before tip for a truckload of food at a sit down establishment that is an icon. With two adults, two teenagers, and a preteen, we could spend close to that at a fast food chain. Food was great, especially the omelet, and the service was fast. Would definitely come here again. As out-of-towners, we were also very pleased with the parking situation. Only complaint was that the bbq sandwich seemed slightly on the small side.",

      "text": "Having to update, not fun! I want to recommend TripleXXX to everyone as THE option for easy going filling in the area. However it isn't worthy of the TV hype. Yes, might be just me: I bet what annoys me brings in the customers. But the breakfasts? Cracker Barrel minus value, an average mess of over processed ingredients just like the college kids make. I have noticed the chili is fantastic. Root beer? It's good. Service? It'll do. The burgers and experience are what get me hot under the snooty Purdue alumni collar. I should have a better undergrad diner! Nearly $10 for a burger with a lil cache of fries? Cash only? No rewards program? Cramped noisy space? 5 Guys right up the hill giving me way more food for my $10 with more space, modern payment options, excellent rewards app, this cannot just be me. I tried an off menu burger with pineapple on it. Fat slice of Hawaiian goodness is magic on beef no matter what you haters say about it also working on pizza. Months later, I still can't believe it was canned pineapple. Watery, mushy, so sad for a restaurant that showed off itself on TV to make Guy cry. OK I know, All Hail Purdue and Boilernation but really, this is my little opinion and ya'll (obviously) are gonna run past me and love this place for all its backwards charm. Allow me a rant because I want a worthy campus burger joint! Well we have it folks: The Tap right up on top of the hill is literally on top of XXX in every way, fantastic atmosphere, wonderful selection of brews (sorry kids 21+), beautiful burgers, pizzas, it's all there just like I dreamed XXX would be. Also Teay's River, best burger and draft selection in the area, take the whole family there, plenty of room. I wonder how long Triple XXX can last like this? Cash, no rewards app, cramped interior, bathroom for 1 mouse, ingredients better served at the Golden M right south, and not the value a diner should be - all these first world problems up against Teays, The Tap, Bru Burger, D.T. Kirbys, Wolfies, Big Woods, AJ's, Town & Gown, Christos, Harry's, Dog n Suds, and even Wendys. Most of those offer all the goods: rewards program, pay with plastic, plenty of space in a modern open atmosphere, superb menu of tasty original foods, and value.",

I would be lying if I told you that wasn't the main reason I stopped in while I was in the area. \n\nOverall the service was really good - I did have to wait a long time for my food (everyone around me arrived after me and was served well before me) - but that is the only drawback in terms of service! The menu has many options, however, if you are a vegetarian like me there are few choices - either a grilled cheese or something off of the breakfast menu. I ordered the veggie omelette with potatoes and toast. It was good, and I would order it again. The burgers (one of the things they are known for!) sounded amazing and smelled so good - I would recommend these to any of my non-vegetarian friends! \n\nThe ambiance is very comfortable and the restaurant itself is very unique, but a diner feel that is hard to find these days. This restaurant is worth a visit; I will be back to try the rootbeer!",

With the high expectations, I was honestly fairly disappointed. I will say I kept it with the original and did not get any of their specialty burgers, so that might have been where I went wrong. My cheese wasn't even barely melted. The sandwich was fairly small. The fries were just okay. I felt like I could've just went to McDonald's next door for a similar burger and probably cheaper. The staff was nice, but they were all cleaning and closing things up long before the restaurant actually closed, so that was disappointing, as well.",

Look up on the hill off of 52 and Salisbury and you will see a bright orange and black striped building that's been around for 90 years! What a place to last 90 years and counting. It's not far from the Purdue campus either. They have a 90th Anniversary Celebration going on and the next drawing will be June 29th. September 29th & December 29th are the next drawings. One of the prizes is a $90 Triple XXX gift card! They were also featured on Diners, Drive-In's, and Dives! \n\nWe were lucky and it wasn't crowded. They have counters with stools. No booths. If it's too crowded they have quite a few picnic tables outside. The service was prompt, fast, and friendly! The coffee came in a Triple XXX mug and was piping hot. The biscuits and gravy were excellent. Good prices and good food you can't beat that.",

My buddy and I enjoyed the chicken strips and their original totchos - nachos but using tater tots instead of fries, a supreme idea! Major props for thinking outside the box and looking for a quality sour . I love a good sour and have a difficult time finding good ones anywhere. The Mad Dog apricot sour on tap was too good for words. The only issue we had was quite unique being a random locally produced video shown on three of the TV screens so we could not avoid it period it was extremely violent and brutally bloody, no ideal for keeping the appetite or making for an enjoyable dining experience. Both of us were rather distracted and put off our food by the horror. I personally am not a sports fan but I have never wished so much to see sports on the TVs! Hopefully when I come back on Fridays for the poutine it will be a more usual bar time which is exactly what this place should be and easily can be.",

      "text": "Came here on 11/18 in the late evening with my father, who has a service dog (vest, license, tag, the whole nine yards). As he was walking to a table, an employee (red shirt white dude) who was obviously intoxicated walked up from behind, put his arm around him, and asked why he needed a service dog. We informed him it was not legal to ask this question, asked him to maintain social distancing, and walked away to a table. About 3 minutes later, a blonde female employee (not visibly drunk) and a man claiming to be the manager who was incredibly drunk came up (again not social distancing) and asked again why my father needed a service dog. Again, we informed them it was illegal to ask. The manager said it can't be illegal because he likes dogs and would not stop asking. After some back and forth, including both employees attempting to pet and interact with my fathers service dog, they moved on. There was apparently a drag show trivia night, during which dancers were not social distancing and repeatedly danced up to our table dispute us asking her not to. After the third time, when the dancer approached the service dog, my father left the building and we stayed to pay our tab for the three beers we were unable to drink. A fight (verbal, but escalated because of alcohol) broke out between a table of 20 something drunk women who did not like service animals and a table of kind middle aged onlookers telling them to knock it off. We flagged down three employees, including the manager, and asked for our bill. The manager, who was so drunk he was not able to make eye contact, informed us he could not hear us and asked to follow us outside. Outside, he demanded to know why my father needed a service dog. We informed him it was illegal to ask and said we would like to pay our bill and leave. He again said that it was okay because he likes dogs, demanded to know what my father's disability is, all the while yelling and invading our (two women) personal space. We asked him to please back away and to calm down, and in reply he moved closer and again demanded to know my fathers disabilities. Feeling threatened and not being permitted to pay our tab despite pleading to, we walked away. Very disappointed in the staff and general attitudes. I love(d) this establishment and was a pre-Covid regular, but will no longer be returning. I recommend you do the same.",

      "text": "Four stars because of the wings!\n\nDropped by at somewhat of an odd lunch hour one Monday. We got their $12 wings (10 pieces) with Dive sauce and blue cheese as a side sauce. We also tried out their chicken burrito.\n\nNow, the burrito was very disappointing. Just bland, and all the chicken seemed to have ended up on one side of the burrito. Will not be getting this again.\n\nHowever, the wings were divine. In fact, a week later we went back to get more. The sauce has a unique taste (and you can get extra on the side). Very juicy. $12 is a little hefty for an appetizer but there's a good portion of wings and it can easily be shared between two. \n\nTry the wings :)",

I had never had it before so I was looking forward to trying it. We got seated as soon as we walked in. We got the Beignets and asked for all 3 sauces so I could try it since it was my first time. Apparently her daughter really likes the beignets, so they ordered an extra order to go for her to share with her mom. Then for my meal, I got the Chilaquiles. The staff were friendly. It wasn't very busy while we were there. The food was okay. I'm glad I experienced it since my friend and her daughter like their food, but I would probably want to go somewhere else next time I visit and we go out to eat.",

      "text": "I'll begin by saying that my wife and I argued over this review when I told her that I was hardly impressed after leaving here. Sure, the food was OK, but getting it (and drinks) was like an act of Congress. If I had my way, this place would barely get two stars. But, my wife made some points that were important for her, and she's also a tough customer. So here it goes...\n\nThere's a certain irony about this place naming and patterning itself after a Texas landmark -- the lack of service here.  Texas' motto is 'friendship,' and the word 'friendly' is derived from the same word (friend).  Service here on our visit was anything but friendly. In fact, our server barely came around ... and when she did, she quickly darted to the adjacent table (who had questions about a beer) in the middle of my father giving his order. It got to the point that the manager had to step in and take care of our table. Back to that in a minute...\n\nThis place is definitely divey, but not in a Sixth Street (Austin) type of way.  If you've been to Sixth Street, you know that the divey places are just that. But this place is more 'Disney' divey. No biggie. \n\nThe food here is actually pretty good. The salsa was surprisingly Texas, as was the queso.  Though fried pork loin (the reason I came here) is hardly a Texas thing (we're a fried beef state), it was good ... served hot and fresh. But if you're looking for sweet tea -- also a Texas staple -- it ain't happening here. And if you get the same waitress we had the misfortune of having, she'll let you know that in a curt tone -- as if she's heard the question a thousand times and is tired of answering it.    \n\nWant any salad dressing here other than ranch or bleu cheese? Forget it. The manager himself told us \"We used to have other dressings but they didn't sell.\" So apparently, a couple of bucks worth of Italian or Thousand Island is too much for these folks.\n\nShould you come here at least once? Perhaps. But don't expect good service ... even if you're a student who's looking to get his drunk on. That said, I'm willing to bet that there are other superior joints in West Lafayette, for food, drink and good times.  And the whole Texas thing here? Don't buy it. We're better than that.",

Parking could be better, but luckily we found a spot around the corner. \n\nThe menu looks pretty great I definitely want to come back and try more things because I couldn't decide what to get! Ultimately, I went with the fish n chips and my boyfriend got the fried chicken sandwich with tater tots. Both were delicious! I loved their homemade tarter sauce and their fries were better than average in my opinion! \n\nThe only thing I had a problem with was the fact that my water tasted kind of sweet like fruit punch. I don't think my mason jar was fully clean. \n\nOther than that, I had a great time here! I like that it's 21+ and maybe I'll have a drink next time too.",

First the good - the beers on tap are exceptional. The \"totchos\" were a creative touch (think nachos, but with tater tots), and the wings were great (tasty, but advertised as \"really hot\", and actually quite mild). On the negative side, we ordered blackened chicken 'n chips, and got breaded instead. They were gracious about putting in another order for what we ordered immediately, and left the breaded chicken strips \"to snack on\" while they redid the order. Both were very tasty.\n\nWe didn't expect, and didn't appreciate, the abundance of naked women on the TV screens. The big bearded guy at the sound table in the fishnet stockings and a skirt was also kinda hard to ignore. The entertainment hadn't started when we left, so he may have been quite entertaining. But all around, the whole experience didn't make for a very relaxing, enjoyable evening (for us, at least), and we'll think twice about coming next time.",

      "text": "Went out for live music last night and decided to check it out here.   We used to come here all the time for live music at Clubhouse/Squirrel Cage. \n\nI can honestly say I can't remember the last time I was here on a Saturday night, 9pm-ish. \n\nThe bar war was. There were lots of large groups out and this is before the music.  It was a good mix of people but there were a lot of 20-somethings.  \n\nI'm not sure who the band was but it was just a guitar player and drummer.  I'm always a fan of bands being set up and soundchecking prior to when they are supposed to start, but this band didn't and that's for another review.  When we arrived, we couldn't tell if they were still having live music because there was nothing set up anywhere. The band could use a better PA system that is more conducive to being able to make out the words he is singing.  \n\nWe found seats against the back wall (where the TV for playing video games used to be) and were served promptly.  We ordered food and it was fantastic.  My wife got some stuffed avocado thing and I got a 'Hand-Spanked' burger with tots.   The burger was truly fantastic.  Very reminiscent of the ClubHouse and the portion of tots was more than I ended up eating.  \n\nThey always have a good beer selection and post the draft beer list on the back chalkboard.  I like to just see the taps with the handles to make a list but I know it is easier the way they do it.  \n\nOnly 'complaint' is that the Men's restroom could use some help.  One of the urinals was out of order and you can tell that it appears they don't put alot of effort into the restroom.  It could use some sprucing up to return it to how cool it was when they first remodeled it.  \n\nI am interested in going back for more live music to see if the sound system other band's bring is any better.  May be a decent, but pricey, investment for The Dive to put their own system in.",

It was spotless & you could literally smell the cleaning products they used when you walk in the door. Obviously, with COVID, that's much appreciated. I ordered grape leaves (came with 2), a bowl of lemon rice soup, a side of falafel (came with 6) with tzatziki, and cheese pie. All of this, plus a 20% tip, was only $16!! I had maybe a couple of bites of the soup because I was already stuffed from everything else, but I couldn't recommend it enough. Soup- perfect. Cheese pie- best I've ever had. Tzatziki- delicious & homemade. Grape leaves- flavorful & tender. Falafel- not my favorite but I'm pretty picky when it comes to falafel. Would 100% eat here again. Customer service was great & they had my order ready FAST. Next time I want to try the spinach and cheese pie & see how it compares to the cheese pie.",

When I used to work in the area I'd buy a stack of pita and a tub of hummus and be set for lunches for the week. The hummus is so light and fluffy- it's my favorite hummus! Their gyros are delicious and super filling.\n\nService is always friendly and quick. It's such a great little lunch spot; I recommend getting bite here if you're ever in the area.",

The owners are Greek the menu is authentic but limited. We ordered the Gyros platter and a salad.\n\nFood came out quickly was hot and delicious this is the only place I have found in Indiana that serves mythos beer.   this beer is authentically Greek and even harder to locate in Chicago.\n\nI would definitely come back and it is an order at the counter style with the food being delivered to your table.",

They even have a drive through, if you want to call ahead and take it home.\n\nAtmosphere is low key and family friendly. Fun old photos on the walls. They do serve beer and wine, if that's your thing. \n\nThe food is so good! Lemon rice soup is the best I have tried. It has a creamy texture, with a light bite of lemon. The gyro meat is homemade and so is the yogurt sauce! You really can beat it anywhere. Feta chucks on the salad are large, fresh and delicious. They have all of the other Greek favorites you might be looking for, including a sampler where you can try the classics! Try this place!",

I did like that this sandwich came with cucumbers in addition to tomatoes and onions. We shared Greek fries. The fries themselves were pretty mediocre but I did like the feta and seasonings on top. The fries were about a dollar more than the online menu says, which always annoys me.

      "text": "Still the best ideal mix of value and quality I have ever found, updating my review since trying T&G over 20 times - tragic that some people have a minor issue with a dish and form an entire opinion for a restaurant. Sure the menu is small, location and atmosphere on a budget, and parking is awkward (was a coffee shop originally) - the thing is: we do this hold back with menus. We end up conflicted. One item jumps out and tempts but we normally play it safe and go for the burger or some familiar item right? But pasta sounds tasty, haven't had good pasta for a long time. Right?! We all do this game. Why? Because the typical corporate food disappoints us 80% of the time. This is why I love Town & Gown. I have been here so many times with many of my family, friends, friend's friends, and gone thru most of the menu, not one bad time yet. This is the restaurant that is all about trying pasta, salmon, lamb, and more! No more burgers and salads snickering at you because you picked the Reuben (so predictable). Never mind, bad example, the Reuben here is fantastic. But that pasta, salmon, appetizers, deserts - it's the classic French style proving the chef knows what he's doing. OK - the breakfast is overpriced (like most places) and if you have complaints (which obviously can happen we had a salad once with dry chicken) ask the staff to fix it! I always leave here wondering why people go to Longhorn, East End Grill, Bistro 501, and other high class restaurants. You'll spend at least $20 more and end up with way less food. I guess eating under a shiny chandelier is worth the extra money for some. For the rest of us, T&G is a breath of fresh air. It will be everything you hoped for. The desert is crazy good too! Cheesecake better than Cheesecake Factory and half the price! Tiramisu like a massive slab of chocolate concrete soaked in espresso drugs. Apple pie, no words for the apple pie. Chocolate cake ripe for gluten-free darkness. The dinner prices are double what they were a few years ago but even $15 for a large fancy Pacific fish is way cheap. I'm real glad to see a proper chef surviving amidst a nasty mix of cheap college feeders and corporate restaurants all throwing enough sodium in their food to fill your FDA daily dose. I've seen a lot of uncomfortable health articles on the issues of that excess processed sodium. Hope to see Town & Gown continue to show off what fresh ingredients and real food should taste like.",

      "text": "Being new in town, I was keen to try out a brunch place and this was recommended by a friend who used to live in the area. Got here around 1pm on a Sunday (we were a group of 6 with a dog). The waitress who initially served us seemed a bit frazzled and was slightly curt. We were asked to wait for about 5 minutes before a place outside became available.\n\nThe outdoor seating is really cute, lots of flowers and has a cozy feel. It definitely gets a little toasty but I'd highly recommend it, especially as I found that when waiting inside, the cooking/greasy smell from the kitchen wafts in and sticks to your hair and clothes. \n\nThe guy who served us was very polite and friendly. They serve big, yummy cups of coffee (I loved their coffee). This is what we got:\n1. Smoked salmon and croissant bennie: The smoked salmon was great. My only issue with this dish is that they pour hollandaise sauce over it as if it's gravy. Next time I'd just get this on the side so I can moderate how much I want over it. The hollandaise sauce was pretty decent, a little less thick than what I'm used to. The croissant bennie was yummy, but by the time you get through to it, it's completely soggy from all the hollandaise sauce. Eggs were perfectly done. \n2. T&G Reuben: Big portion. This was really yummy and well done. It comes with a side of their \"home fries\" which appear to be roast potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned, but quite oily. \n\nWould I go back? Yes. I'd really like to try out their other brunch items and lunch/dinner menu.",

The only options I see for downstairs seating is a patio (which would be fine in nice weather) or a couple of small tables just inside the front door where everyone checks in which doesn't look very cozy.  I'm not aware of more ample indoor seating downstairs.",

The food quality simply was not good enough for the price. The omelet's ingredient was sandwiched (not well mixed) meaning that all the spinach was jammed in the lower corner and each ingredient stacked next to each other. \n\nThe croissant bennie was very very salty.

So, I ordered the tiramisu for dessert and it didn't look like what the other pictures on Yelp looked like. It looked like it was caked with chocolate sauce and cocoa powder. No, spoon imprint like the other pictures on Yelp. I've had tiramisu at other places this one had so much rum in it it wasn't good. It overpowered the entire dessert.

I haven't had the chance to visit the restaurant yet given the current COVID-19 situation, but we had food delivered via GrubHub. \n\nI'm a pescatarian so these are the dishes I tried:\n- spicy pancakes: this is a staple Korean dish for (I get it pretty much every time I go out for Korean food). 5/5\n- spicy squid: 5/5\n- spicy seafood udon noodles: 3/5\n\nWe also got 2 small complimentary dishes: boiled broccoli with some pickled vegetables and a type of miso soup. Both were fantastic!\n\nAlthough all the dishes we ordered were labelled as spicy, it's not an overbearing kind of heat. I felt it was just the right amount (for me personally). Portions are reasonable for the prices. They have a good variety of seafood, vegetarian and non-veg items on the menu. \n\nWill definitely be ordering from them again. Keep up the great work. \n\nOn a side note: the reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because all the items were delivered in non-recyclable containers/plastic ware/ styrofoam packaging.",

      "text": "Came to visit my sister and her friends at Purdue and they picked this Korean restaurant to eat at! Kimchi is located right off the road, next to a gas station with the restaurant name in big letters.\n\nWalking in around 2pm, there weren't many people so the atmosphere was quiet and nice. The interior was spacious and would be great for big parties (we comfortably sat 8 of our friends with us).\n\nI had ordered the Korean cold noodles and the bowl was HUGE!! I had eaten a lot of KBBQ at a different restaurant the day before so I wanted something light to counterbalance all the meat. It was the perfect choice in my opinion. \n\nThe broth was a good balance between refreshing and tangy and there were many noodles in my bowl - I was a happy camper. They also gave you two bottles of sauce and vinegar if you wanted to add a little bit more of each into your broth.\n\nThe waiter was very polite and very friendly - he made our experience great. Only downside about Kimchi is that it is a little pricy compared to other Korean restaurants I've been to. Overall, good experience and would come here next time I'm at Purdue!",

      "text": "My wife and I were in West Lafayette visiting our daughter, SIL and granddaughter and tried this place, which was new to me and my wife, but which my daughter and her family had patronized before. We ordered delivery, which arrived promptly and accurately via DoorDash, and were, with one exception, very pleased with our meal.\n\nThe one exception was the seafood yaki udon (you can get some Japanese food here as well as Korean). My wife didn't think this meal lived up to its picture on the restaurant webpage. On the other hand, she was VERY satisfied with the seafood pancake, and will not hesitate to order it again.\n\nMy daughter and I had the bulgogi, and we were also satisfied with that, me very much so. The meat was flavorful and juicy, and the portion was large enough for me to get two substantial dinners from it. (The leftover portion microwaved very nicely.) \n\nWe also all shared an order of vegetarian dumplings, and even though I am not much one for vegetables, I found these quite tasty. \n\nI think the next time we eat from here (and there will certainly be a next time) I might like to try the Korean spicy pork, provided that it's not too spicy. It's the closest thing I could see on the menu that resembles Korean barbeque. It will be hard, however, to pass up the bulgogi.",

We all ordered the bibimbap and it was delicious in both volume and the amount of toppings (meat, eggs, veggies, etc). You can tell they make the dish in a traditional pot as it was even tastier to scrape the slightly charred (but not burnt) rice off the bottom and sites of the ginormous pot. The one star deduction is for the bulgogi flavor. I am use to the meat having more of a profile other than being soft/bland. Other than that, great food. Also tried the japchae, which could have been more for the price we paid but pretty tasty.",

It was a Saturday night, but we got right in and sat in the \"patio\" area.  The service was fine, but I could tell that it,might suffer on a busier night. I ordered a Smithmick's and settled in. The appetizer was the Pot of Gomd and came out pretty quickly. I had the fisherman's stew and we also had corn beef and cabbage as well as the patty melt sandwich and breaded tenderloin. Everything came out piping hot and was quite tasty. I would like to go back and try a few other good looking items.  One caution, if any is thr parking...not much.",

I was super comfortable here, parking was easy, and the food was phenomenal! I had a nice beer and an amazing half-order of corned beef, mashed potatoes, and cabbage. Mind you, this was only a half-order and was quite the heap of delicious food! The meal also included a tasty slice of soda bread. I'll definitely be back!!",

They were very accommodating and welcoming from the initial phone call. They put our group on the patio which has a roof, heaters, tent-like sides. The patio was quieter than inside and was warm even on a cold rainy night. Great service for a large party.",

      "text": "One of my favorite restaurants in West Lafayette! It's family owned and it has one of the best fish and chips and pint of Guinness you can find in the country! The food is amazing. I would recommend the fish and chips, Reuben, shepherd's pie, and Pot of Gold's. \n\nPrices are a little bit more expensive than the rest of West Lafayette, but you are paying for quality. It has a big inside Irish pub feel and a back patio for those summer months. They have a good amount of TVs to watch sports too. Service has been adequate for every time I've went. Overall, I love this place!",

It was nice because we went during an off time and were able to sit inside to eat without a huge crowd. The beer was the usual big woods beer- I live and die by their cinnamon blonde. It tastes like a snickerdoodle beer and is incredible. My mom, a lifelong miller lite drinker loves their six foot blonde. And we had a sample of some of their spirits and they were incredible too. I spent way too much already or I would have gotten some of those to go. \n\nTheir food is a smaller selection than the speedway or Nashville location but they still have some good stuff. I forgot to take photos but I got the grilled chicken sandwich (yum), my mom got the nachos and my dad got the wings. They both loved their meals too. Absolutely will be back. Especially if we ever get out of this pandemic.",

All in all the meal was good, but I felt the food was kind of pricey. We enjoyed: \n\nSide Greek salad (excellent taste and value)\nIndividual Margherita pizza (large portion for an individual but it was filling with the thicker style crust)\nCandied bacon bomb burger with Parmesan truffle fries. It was very good but huge. Glad I shared this with my husband. Not sure it's a $15 burger, but it was tasty. \nSignature pulled pork sandwich - generous serving of pork. My son took half home. \n\nTips: \n1-Upgrade to Parmesan truffle fries. They are fabulous and you will so glad you did. \n2-Sample some beers to get exactly what I want. We ended up loving the Java red.\n3-Servings are large. Consider sharing. \n4-The manager greeted every table and I like that extra touch of service.",

They fixed things happily, but the rest of the order is sitting there getting cold while you're waiting for them to remake whatever was wrong. \n\nWasn't impressed w the burger. Ordered med rare and it was well done. Bun was hard. But pizza is pretty good. Our favorite is the Homestead. And the cheesy bread is delicious, but not enough of it to justify the price.

The location is convenient to the campus and sparkling clean. We sat in the bar area. The bartender was responsible for tables, making drinks and carry out. She seemed to be overwhelmed a bit but did fine taking our order and delivering our food and drinks in a timely manner. I had a Greek salad with chicken. The lettuce was crispy and chicken was hot and juicy. Tomato slices were thick cut but soft and tasted close to the end of their time. The portion of black olives was insane unless olives are your favorite part of a salad. Dressing was good, served on the side and there was plenty. I also ordered the Parmesan truffle fries. Don't expect them to be super crispy but expect tons of flavor. They are really good! I think I'll try a sandwich next visit.",

We all went for burgers and two did brews. Enjoyed it all, no one had complaints, we miss Stacked Pickle for its amazing appetizers and creative burgers at a great value but this will do OK despite fierce competition. I personally take to Teay's River with it's massive menu and fresh drips. The Tap drowns everyone with an overwhelming beer list. Big Woods mixes those two together to boast on the campus vibes, easy parking, and Nashville inspired fare.",

      "text": "Was really excited to try this place as it looked like a nicer dinner place that campus needed. Unfortunately it fell short in most categories. For starters the service was very sub par. Drinks/beers were asked about and the explanation was less than what was actually written about them. The food tastes pretty good, but for ~12-15$ a plate I was thinking there would something memorable or even my medium rare burger being at least slightly pink. The beer and drinks were also quite good, but again 12-15$ for a specialty cocktail and 7$ for a pint should give you something that is high quality and unique. The ambiance also doesn't reflect what they're going for as it looks just like Stacked Pickle did (sports bar) but it's a brewery/distillery/cocktail bar. I would say you can do much better at LBC, Teays, The Bryant, or The tap for less money.",

The quality of service, the variety of options, the location, the venue itself, the price, all of it. You just have to go there to get the full effect. But here's my breakdown.\n\nThe good. \n- Bru Burger is located in downtown Lafayette right next to the train station and foot bridge into West Lafayette. It's an easy walk here after going to the Farmer's market downtown or if you're touring Purdue and want to walk over.\n- It's easy on your wallet. You get what you pay for. Good food isn't (usually) cheap and cheap food isn't (usually) good. So yes, it's more expensive than McDonalds. That being said, you can get an artisan burger for $11-14. It's not going to break the bank like many other restaurants of the same caliber might.\n\nThe better.\n- The service is good. Very good. Employees seem to enjoy their work, and are super friendly. They keep finding quality employees. The management doesn't seem very involved in a visible role (no one comes around asking how everything is, etc.), but your waiter or waitress takes such good care of you that it doesn't matter. And I'm sure management is doing their job well, albeit behind the scenes.\n- The venue. It's trendy, modern, and fun. Their side patio is ideal for outdoor dining. The screen walls come down in the winter and its heated to provide excellent outdoor dining even in the cold. And nothing beats eating a Bru burger outside in the warm spring breeze.\n\nThe best.\n- Yup. I saved the best for last: the food. \n- WOWZA. The burgers are delicious, and I've had nearly all of them (not at the same time). Not that hungry? Build your own starting with a \"burger snack\" base for the perfect miniature burger.\n-The fries. Dining with a friend? Get the appetizer fries. It's like twice the cost as a side of fries for about 4 times the amount. Plus, it's served with their homemade black pepper mayo. I repeat for the people in the back...GET THE BLACK PEPPER MAYO.\n- Get. The. Nachos. You'll thank me later. Especially if you're getting a takeout order, the pork nachos are the best thing on the menu. The queso, the pickled jalapeños, the pico, the seasoned pork, all of it. It'll blow your mind.\n\nThey have some locations in Indy which are also good, but the one here in Lafayette is my favorite. You won't be sorry you came here.",

      "text": "We happened on this place 6 weeks ago when things were still very very quiet in Lafayette. Enjoyed our burger and beer so much that, coming through here again, I made a reservation for outside seating on a Saturday night. When we arrived it was MUCH busier - including a \"packed\" (by our new Covid parameters) indoors. The servers were so busy that at first I worried we would be forgotten. This was completely not the case! Though our server did take a few minutes to get to us (again because he was busy with others), our drink order came out VERY quickly and our food followed shortly. The fries were so crisp I had a hard time not eating them all immediately. Our two burgers (Mexicali and Greek Lamb) were done exactly as ordered and we got to sample 4 different beers including some local Indiana brews. I was so impressed with how the operation was run this night that I asked to speak to the manager to give my compliments. Since we are now driving between Atlanta and Minneapolis instead of flying, I anticipate that we will be in Lafayette again and when we are, I will look forward to another Burger & Beer meal!",

They employ a ton of staff so they keep up with the volume once you're in. The burgers are obviously the go to here and you really can't go wrong with any choice. I had the Patty Melt, which may seem a little underwhelming, but boy did it pack a ton of flavor. They cook your burger exactly how you want it too which is nice. The only flack is that the side portions of fries (while delicious) are a little small.",

      "text": "It pains me to write this review, because I like this restaurant, but I had a very bad experience on my last visit. Let me preface this by saying that the food was ok. We tried something different with the impossible Hiki'ole (which tasted like a meat burger and was pretty good) and the black bean burger (which I really didn't like). \n\nAs in my previous review, I've touted Bru Burger to be one of the best places to eat at/ take out food from during COVID. For that reason, we have been getting curbside pickup here regularly. On my last order, as usual, we called to put in the order for curbside pickup, at which point we checked that they would do curbside pickup, to which the person over the phone said yes. When it was time to make the pickup, after I drove up to the restaurant and gave them a call, the staff member that answered the phone was very rude. They told me that I need to come into the restaurant and that they don't do curbside pickup on he weekend (because they do the open air dining on weekends). Upon telling them that I checked about curbside pickup just 15 minutes prior (when I put in the order), I was told that maybe the person who took the order wasn't aware of what they claimed. When I said that I've gotten curbside pickup before, I was told that if I'm not going to come in and get the food, they don't know what else they can do for me. Since I wasn't going into the restaurant (for personal reasons) and stated so, the staff member finally gave in and brought the food out to me. At this point, they made a fuss about me having to sign the bill, which I've never had to do here before. They've always brought the food out to my car and left it in the trunk. The staff member wouldn't give me the food till I signed the check. I signed the check, but I was very disappointed with this experience.",

This visit in particular was to celebrate my graduation from Purdue. \n\nWe had the triple dip & each had a burger w/fries or onion rings. I do wish more bread was served with the dip, but they quickly brought us extra. We also had a bowl of chili - new to me and definitely something I'd order again. Hands down, the BRU Onion Rings are THE BEST I've ever had. The burgers were also good - the only potential drawback was they weren't exactly cooked as requested. \n\nThanks for a great celebration!",

      "text": "Note: according to staff, the \"veggie burger\" and the \"black bean burger\" are not vegan. Previous review was from opening week and the information I got was wrong. They still have the portabello mushroom sandwich and impossible burger which are vegan. My first time around, the waitress told me all I had to do was sub out the mayo to make the garbanzo and mushroom patty vegan. It'd be really nice for the menu to specify exactly why something isn't vegan, so that people that don't want to eat any animal products don't have to rely on the staff to know the difference. \n\nI'd say I'm much less excited about the place now that I know that my only choices are the portabello and the impossible if it's in stock.\n\nOLD review:\n\nI'm really happy with this burger joint! It's a regional chain with restaurants in Ohio, Kentucky, and (of course) Indiana. \n\nThe menu is very clearly marked to show which items are vegan or vegetarian. For vegans, the menu is pretty skimpy on the appetizer sides. It looks like it may be onion rings or the soft pretzel without the pub cheese (ask first if the pretzel has any butter). We skipped straight ahead to the salad.  \n\nWe tried the quinoa salad (spring mix, crispy quinoa, edamame hummus, cucumber, portobello, peppadew pepper jam, and white balsamic-orange vinaigrette). Not at all what I was expecting - the quinoa is mashed into a ball and fried. The rest of the salad comes kind of decomposed, with long slices of portobello. It was delicious. \n\nAnd...there are THREE vegetarian burgers:\n+ Impossible burger - we ordered medium well, and comes with vegan cheese, vegan mayo mustard, house ketchup, greens\n+ Garbanzo and mushroom patty (vegetarian)- it comes with mayo, we substituted for vegan mayo. Comes on an oat bun\n+ Black bean burger (vegetarian) - I'm not entirely sure what makes this one vegetarian and not vegan (did not try). \n\nFew other details: Staff was very friendly, and we were seated quickly. They have have a large selection of rotating local and regional beers, and a good number of wines by the glass on the menu. But no vegan desserts. \n\nQuite impressive to have this many vegan and vegetarian options, I'm sure we'll be back here next time we're in town.",

Our server, Nick, was fantastic! He made me feel way less weird about my...unpopular...meat preferences.\n\nWe didn't try any apps or desserts; I'm not really sure how anyone would have room (however, I will say that I may end up making a special trip for the whiskey fudge brownie, which sounds and looks delicious)! My husband ordered The Beginning Burger and fries, and I had the Honey-Chipotle BBQ burger. We both really enjoyed our burgers (mine was particularly massive); the fries were pretty good too (I  tried one, and they were pretty potato-y, which is the only way I like fries).\n\nAs for my burger specifically, it could be a bit messy to eat (mostly because pulled pork falls out easily), but the crunch from the onion ring adds great texture. It does have a bit of a kick (as the name implies), but it's not overbearing.\n\nThe decor is modern and streamlined, though conversations seem to carry throughout the room. The carpeted area with tables seems like it might be a bit cramped; navigating your way through to get to the bathroom can be a challenge.\n\nAll in all, we had an excellent experience, and we'll definitely be back!\n\nUpdate: We came back and brought our kids. The kids menu offers options that will appeal to most kids (burgers, nuggets, mac and cheese, popcorn shrimp, and grilled cheese), and the kids entrees come with a side and a drink. They're pretty competitively priced to comparable restaurants. My kids had the cheeseburger with onion rings and the mac and cheese with fruit. I thought the mac and cheese didn't have a lot of flavor, but my kids both loved their food.\n\nMy husband got the Beginning Burger and fries again, and I tried the Memphis BBQ Melt, which I highly recommend!",

When I heard that they have California burritos on their menu, I  had to get one. I was not disappointed! The burrito had a generous amount of meat (Pastor for me), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, and French Fries! The taste was amazing, but it was wrapped a little sloppily. My teenagers enjoyed their nachos supreme, and breaded tenderloin. \n\nWe called our order ahead of time, and it was ready in 15 minutes. I'm glad we did, because when we arrived to pickup, the order line was 4 cars deep (at 5pm on a Thursday!). This is totally going into our takeout rotation, there is something for everyone on their menu. The lady working the window (and phone) was super friendly and cheerful.",

      "text": "We've been wanting to try their burgers for a few weeks now, but their opening hours are a little unusual so it's been closed whenever we've gone (call ahead!). \n\nWe finally made it on a Saturday around 11.30am but realised that on Saturdays  they only serve one item (and that's till they run out) - Mexican Birria.\nThis is a stew that is normally made with lamb, but here they serve it with beef. You can have it in different styles: over fries, in a cup, as a taco or quesadilla. We decided to try it over fries (also comes with queso, guac, jalapeños). The beef is very tender and resembles pulled meat. The birria reminded me of Indian beef curries that I've had but not as spicy. The combo of the birria over the fries was yummy. The guac in particular was fantastic and I liked that they didn't go crazy with the queso - just the right amount. \n\nOverall, this is a yummy dish and worth trying if you've never had it before, but I can't say I loved it. We will definitely be going back to try their burgers which so many people seem to love. \n\nService was great and the staff were super helpful.",

      "text": "I drove by a couple of weeks ago and saw a new tenant in the old shack, and I knew I had to stop in. After hearing a client talking about the food, that sealed it.\n\nNothing fancy, the Wicked Food Shack is just that, a shack serving wickedly good food. To order, you either use the walk-up window or drive-thru. The menu is fairly simple with burgers, hot dogs, tenderloin, fries, tacos, burritos, esquite (Mexican corn in a cup, I got to know it as elotes in Texas), and other goodies. The menu is ever expanding - look for some dessert items in the future. \n\nI had the stuffed burger, which comes with fresh cut fries. Cheddar cheese and chopped bacon are stuffed inside a hamburger patty and then cooked to perfection. Normally I don't order bacon on a burger because I don't get a good bite on a slice of bacon due to my weird uneven teeth. With the chopped bacon stuffed in the patty, I got all the bacon taste in each bite. No need for condiments on this burger, the juices do it all.\n\nThe thick fries are freshly cut, and the interior steams while in the fryer. The exterior is crispy while fluffy on the inside. \n\nI also had the chili cheese fries. The same fresh cut fries are slathered with cheese sauce and house made chili. Although not as spicy as I prefer, this chili will fit in well with the local palate. These fries would be a great snack when it's 10 degrees out.\n\nThe Wicked Food Shack is going into my lunch and dinner rotation, if just for the burgers and fries. I'm going to have to work my way through the menu.",

We also tried a jalapeño burger, which was great. The menu looked great, too, with a chili dog that looks to set the bar for chili dogs, and all sorts of other tasty odds and ends.

However it seemed like this restaurant was somewhat attached to a community center, play park, apartment, study area, and church. There is plenty of parking and areas to sit outside which was nice, especially in the summer months. \n\nThe menu isn't too crazy big so it won't make it too difficult to choose what you want to eat. However I would recommend the mushroom pizza as it is refreshing and light tasting as there isn't red sauce on it. White sauce pizzas are one of my favorites and this little cafe did not disappoint. I shared this pizza and a Caesar salad with one person and it was plenty of food for a lunch time meal. We even had some pizza left over. The fresh greens on top of the pizza added such a nice touch which was wonderful. There wasn't anything special about the salad, I would just say it tasted pretty classic. But it was good that is for sure. \n\nI also noticed the huge study area that is attached to this Café which was closed at the moment due to COVID19 however I can imagine that this is a hot place to study because there were a lot of places to sit and even private room areas for silent study.",

      "text": "Update: returned on Sunday afternoon, and it was super busy. Staff was still friendly and service was fast. Had a latte and the Harvest Pizza special- a wood fired pizza special with butternut squash, pork, sage, and onions. 10/10. \n\nThis is probably my favorite coffee shop in West Lafayette. It has a huge breakfast, lunch, and coffee menu. Staff is friendly and quick, and the general atmosphere is very calm and welcoming. I had an almond milk latte, which was hot and tasty. Coffee is high quality. I also had a bacon, egg, and cheese breakfast sandwich. Egg was cooked well but under seasoned. The bacon was cooked perfectly, and the everything beagle it came on was tasty. The patio out front is a great place to sit in the shade and enjoy the weather.",

      "text": "Wow! What a great place to grab lunch when in West Lafayette.  About a mile north of Purdue, this place was packed on a Tuesday.  I found the last parking spot in their lot and headed inside.  The restaurant has indoor and outdoor seating.  I placed my order at the front counter and after paying, gave my name and waited for the pickup counter to call it out.  Not the most efficient if people have the same name, but the food came out so quickly that as long as I was paying attention, I could get my food in hardly no time!  Fortunately, there were plenty of seats inside, so I sat down with my selections.  \n\nI went with the Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad sandwich and the Red Skin Potato Salad as my choice for a side.  The sandwich comes served on a rustic Italian bread (fairly thick) and the chicken salad was about an inch deep across the sandwich!  No skimping here!  The sandwich had just hint of blue cheese for depth to go with the dried cranberries, walnuts, lettuce, and Roma tomato slices.  Very hearty and flavorful!\n\nThe potato salad was excellent!  Instead of a mustard base, this creamy coating tasted more like butter.  The potatoes were diced and al dente for a nice bite, not mushy.  Just right for me!\n\nThe price for both options was under $10, so very reasonably priced for the amount of food offered.  I highly recommend this combo.\n\nOh, and before I forget, the walls are covered with text.  Some are informational, some inspirational, and others humorous.  It gave me something to look at while waiting for my order or while eating since I was dining by myself.\n\nNote:  The customers are expected to clear their own tables and deposit the dishes and trash at a station by the door.  The staff does come by and clean the tables as well.\n\nReview #283",

Other reviews made it sound like it gets busy around lunchtime, but I had no issues finding empty tables on a saturday afternoon. I loved how quiet it was and it was a nice place to work. I would have liked to say comfy place to work too, but they have limited comfortable seating. Wifi was good. \n\nI got the almond milk latte and a Mediterrano Pizza (based on employee recommendation as the best pizza they have - see picture). I felt that both the latte and the pizza were just mediocre. Nothing to keep coming back for. I've heard their panini's are good, but that will have to be a future review. Prices would have been reasonable if the food tasted a little better. \nI also have to say that the folks working behind the counter were very nice and courteous.",

      "text": "I was in town visiting some friends at Purdue, and they suggested that we go here for brunch. It is in a good location, and the inside is very bright and airy. Rather than table service, you order the food and pick it up at the counter, so if you're looking to go somewhere to eat and really be able to talk with friends this is a good place to go. I think the food and prices matched pretty well, but the reason for my 3 stars was because of a pineapple situation. That sounds really weird, I know, but I am allergic to pineapple, so I asked about what fruit came in the seasonal fruit cup. Being allergic to pineapple sucks because it's so yummy, but I just can't have it. They said that there is pineapple in the fruit cup, so I asked if I could have double of whatever other fruit they were feeling instead of pineapple. When I got my fruit cup, they ended up still putting pineapple in it and charging me for a whole other fruit cup even though my sandwich was supposed to come with one. I was really confused and also worried because if someone was more allergic than me and ended up with pineapple, that could be a really big problem :( \n\nThe food and coffee were good, but I was a bit put off by the whole experience when I went up to the counter to tell the person ringing what happened and she seemed very reluctant to have the manager come over to try to do a refund. I ended up just passing it off and deciding that I probably wouldn't go back.",

      "text": "In town on business and heard about Cafe Literato and checked it out for lunch. This is definitely a spot that I would both recommend and return to if I were local. The restaurant is open and just a nice space. I liked that you order at the counter and then head up to the pass to get your food from the kitchen.\n\nI had the Brick Oven Pork sandwich and a bowl of tomato bisque soup. The sandwich was really good but what put it over the top was that Italian batard bread. Wow. Nice and light/crispy on the outside and soft and moist inside. While the pork was good, all I kept thinking about was replacing the smoked pork with some really good porketta. It would be just killer on that bread. Either way, I'd suggest they hit the sandwich with some pan drippings because the only drawback was that the pork was a little dry. Not to fear, I was dunking it in the bisque, which was delicious...rich, flavorful, and with little bits of crushed tomato left over from the blending process. So good. \n\nI'd probably head back there tomorrow but have other joints to patronize and try out while I'm here.\n\nThanks, Literato, for a great lunch.",

Order at the counter, find a table.\n\nThe menu offered lots of expected beverages, including smoothies and baked goods, sandwiches, salads and soups. Ordered an all-veggie grilled sandwich and appreciated the offering: eggplant, zucchini, peppers.  Unfortunately, the tomato soup was sweet and cloying, and the grilled cheese just ok.

As first time guests we got the beignets half off and they were AMAZING. We had the eggs Blackstone benedict, cinnamon roll French toast which came with side of eggs and the southwest omelet. This was a great balance of sweet and flavory for 2 people ( maybe too much). Will be visiting again for outdoor seating now that the weather is nice.",

They are doing a good job following COVID protocols. The best part is the food. They have so many good choices it was hard to choose! We started with a plate of the bomb complimentary beignets and awesome coffee. Our table had the Southwestern Scramble without the andouille, the Croissant French Toast, the Cinnamon Roll French Toast and the Salmon Bowl. Everything was fresh and amazing! We were a little rushed so our server packed up part of it to go. She was incredibly accommodating. Really enjoyed this meal. I would highly recommend it!",

After 4 years of attending Purdue, I decided to try Another Broken Egg Cafe and was extremely impressed.\n\nPositives\n\n-Food: The food is incredible with flavors and combinations that you really can't get anywhere else. The vibe is Cajun with many of the dishes having crawfish, anduille, shrimp, etc, but they also have traditional fares for anyone. The chefs really put craft into their dishes.\n\n-Service: It's tough to get a table on the weekends, but the staff is super nice. Our waitress was very accommodating, kept refills coming promptly, and aided in our questions on the menu.\n\n-Drinks: They have really good coffee, brunch cocktails, and specialty coffee/sweet drinks for anyone to enjoy.\n\nNegatives\n\n-Price: While the food is quite good, the price is pretty steep for most college students or really anyone getting brunch/breakfast. Most dishes are 12-18$, coffee 3.50$, and specialty drink 5+$ vs the typical 6-10$ fares at many diners around. The ingredients reflect the price, but usually that spend is reserved for nicer dinners for most people.",

My daughter wanted to stay on or close to campus so she suggested Another Broken Egg. I'll confess that I had already selected another restaurant in West Lafayette and had even selected my beverage snd entree so I was silently disappointed. We walked in and was immediately greeted by a friendly hostess and seated. Our waitress, Cheyenne, was great. She suggested many of the house favorites. I settled on the seasonal corned beef, Brussels, and blistered tomatoes topped with two over easy eggs. My was I surprised how good my meal was! The eggs were perfectly cooked with crispy edges. The yolk blended beautifully with the corned beef, potatoes, and veggies. There was a dollop of sour cream that brought all together so well. My husband had the chicken fried steak Benedict, which he said was good and my daughter had the salmon Benedict that she said was good but had a tad too much seasoning salt. Over all we had a great breakfast that did not disappoint.",

I don't understand if these waitresses can't hear or what but coconut cream is not milk and no eggs does not mean eggs.

They were very busy which I expected on a Sunday so I did use the Yelp app to reserve a spot in line which was awesome and they sat us down almost immediately. My server seemed very unknowledgeable about the menu and what it offered. I asked if they did any flavored iced coffees and she said she wasn't sure and she'd check. She just brought me a very iced down coffee with little flavor that I wasn't thrilled about. Gave her the benefit of the doubt, maybe she's new and that's fine. I ordered the eggs Benedict and my mom had an omelet. The food came and while it looked amazing the taste just wasn't.. my eggs were cold and the flavors were just okay. My mom said her omelet seemed very over done and wasn't too happy either. My favorite part was the complimentary pancake beignets. Those were soft, hot and yummy but we didn't get them until after paying for our bill. \n\nWhile I didn't enjoy this first time experience, I do think it was just a busy day and maybe I didn't order the best they had to offer. I would still come back and try something new maybe sometime.",

Everyone was very pleasant to work with.\n\nWe ordered the lobster Brie and cheese omelet and broken egg biscuit sandwich. Both plates were generous and filling. The omelet was extremely rich. It was savory and very decadent with the Brie, cream cheese and loads of lobster. Accompanying it was a generous cup of fresh fruit. The sandwich wasn't a pick up and eat lunch, rather neat but eaten best with a fork and to really indulge, order it with an extra side of gravy! The sandwich was an over size biscuit with a chicken tender on it covered it n Country gravy! Oh buddy, this is Nirvana after a day tailgating if you know what I mean!   ;  ) \n\nThe coffee was a hearty cup. Not the lightweight wussy stuff watered down by so many places. It is hyper sized on the caffeine. \n\nThe only negative is that the wait is sooo long when smelling what is cooking. My advice is if you are reading this on yelp, put your name on the list in advance and reduce your wait time, it's worth both the wait and the food!",

The biscuits were fluffy, but that gravy was just wrong. I took it to work and gave it to a coworker. My friend ordered the pound cake French toast with eggs and sausage. She was really happy with it, as well as the banana fosters syrup. She did not like the sausage.

The wait was about 30 minutes long and we were seated at one of the high tables. \n\nI decided to try out one of their seasonal specials (Southern Benedict with potatoes) as they were going to be taking this off the menu shortly. My husband got the Chilaquiles. \n\nI can't recommend the Southern Benedict. The biscuit was dry and really bland, one poached egg was done well but the other was overcooked. The sausage was really good but there was way too much ham (that too very salty!) to really appreciate the flavours of the dish. The side of potatoes was pretty average, couldn't really taste any seasoning. Overall a pretty disappointing dish. We did inform our waitress about the salty ham and she took our feedback very well.  \n\nThe chilaquiles on the other hand was definitely better. Well garnished. I thought it was a little meat-heavy but some people may really enjoy this. \n\nCoffee: Not the greatest. And was lukewarm when served.  \n\nBecause it was my first time we got treated with their classic sugar dusted beignets which were an absolute delight! \n\nWould I go back? Yes, to try out their other dishes before settling on a final verdict.",

      "text": "Yes! YES! YEEEAAAASSSSSS!!!!!\n\nBefore reviewing the food let me tell you this was the best breakfast / brunch experience since Ruby Slipper in my home state of Louisiana, that's in New Orleans. \n\nThis was and is the best meal I've had before noon in 4 years! That includes my own cooking and I'm pretty damn awesome. Despite being a franchise whomever is training and implementing the hospitality is spot on SOUTHERN CHARM. Friendly and not just our waitress Cheyenne, the Manager Seth and every single employee I saw was smiling and being friendly. Only one waitress complaining about a table that had been finished with their meal for quite some time. I get it though, these folks make their money turning tables. Let me explain what this joint gets that others miss...the second, third and fourth visits that end up making you willing to wait 45 minutes for the best experience in the area. I will and gladly.\n\nSo on this occasion we used the yelp waiting list function for the first time. Wait estimate was 22 min and it took us about 20 minutes to arrive from the east side. We arrived and within a few minutes of arriving were sent a text and seated. \n\nLet me be honest, I wanted to hate it on the drive there. Another knock off want to be NOLA restaurant claiming southern cuisine. \"Flashback\" walking up to the hostess I heard chubby checker (my moms favorite), and in front of me was a hutch that my grandmother had; I scowled. \n\nHere we are looking over the menu, which I was delighted was not the same paper menu that we first grabbed on arrival. I simply decided to choose my normal routine, first visit breakfast. Here is was the supreme omelette, which as offered was what I was raised on. Eggs, sausage, bacon, onions, mushrooms and Colby jack (gods omelette cheese). I added a 1/2 biscuit and gravy as well as grits. J had the chicken and waffles with home fries. \n\nDrinks arrive and the Bloody Mary needed some pepper and a splash of pepper sauce to meet my perfectionist standards. J orders a strawberry mimosa because I neglected to inform her that we were drinking early. Both perfect as well as the strong coffee that I sipped.\n\nFood arrives and NEWS FLASH; we had to add seasoning to nothing!!!! \n\nFirst time visitor gets some perks (this is the well placed hook) FREE biscuit beignets arrive and I was skeptical despite J trying and loving them. They are different but delicious and if you omit the orange marmalade then you are void of taste buds.  \n\nThe freaking omelette, my mèmè would have loved this. The biscuits and sausage gravy!?!? Tender fresh biscuits with amazing sausage gravy (best in Indiana).  The grits were a little bouisey (diced tomatoes green onions and bacon). I pushed that aside for grits only... OMG perfect. Second bite with the bouisey topping; eye rolling and delightful. English Muffin with a light smear of butter to sop up lost bits and it, too was perfect.\n\nSpeaking for J as she ate some of mine as usual!!  I tried her Chicken and Waffles with Chipotle Honey on the side. It was her first chicken and waffles and she asked me how to eat it and I offered my opinion which was a fail. So the chipotle honey is a strong honey with slight chipotle kick. Independent of the sauce, she loved it. \n\nThe honest final comment is everything on the menu speaks to my southern soul and if you find yourself trapped in Lafayette, Indiana, you should make your way to this place and piss us all off because the seating is perfect but there is already a wait! \n\nBTW, the music and ambiance was great the entire meal!",

      "text": "tldr: The food here is solid/fine, like you'd expect at a breakfast diner. But the prices are more like restaurant level rather than cheap diner level. The result is a fairly satisfying breakfast for more money than I'd expect to spend.\n\nMy girlfriend and I shared a plate of plain French toast, which was not great (not hot, rubbery). We also shared a seafood omelette, which was good (lots of shrimp, pretty big, sauce on top). This came with an English muffin (like the French toast, not hot), a small bowl of grits (fine, plain), and a piece of ham (nice flavor). We were supposed to get a side of bacon too but only got one strip. Weird? She also got coffee and we spent $35 with tip. So again it's not like the food was bad, but it was just okay for that much money.\n\nThey do have a nice feature on the menu of writing how many calories each dish has.\nThis is helpful for portion control!\n\nWe went on a Saturday morning around 9am and it was not busy (we were seated right away). By 10 or so it got a bit crowded.",

      "text": "This is a cute little breakfast place adjacent to the Purdue campus (located, conveniently, across the street from the Armstrong Building). It's busy for brunch, so there is a wait to get seated, but otherwise service is friendly and speedy. My server,  Brianna, was very nice and had great timing. They definitely earn their tips here! I got a Cranberry Mimosa, which was tart and tasty and perfect for the humid and rainy morning. I ordered Shrimp and Grits for my meal-it's a southern themed restaurant. The actual grits themselves are plain and overly bland, but a good texture. The accompanying sauce and baby shrimp/ sausage add the perfect amount of spice, and the garlic bread pancake things on the side are buttery and tasty. Worth the wait!",

Admittedly this is a low bar, as breakfast sucks pretty much everywhere. We are breakfast connoisseurs, and heretofore we have found nothing but mediocrity. No more.\n\nIt's called \"Another Broken Egg Cafe\" and its on Northwestern Avenue, across from the Physics building. The crowds are deserved and the prices (no student budget here) well-earned. If you arrive after 9A on a weekend morning, prepare to wait for a table. And that was before this posting.",

      "text": "An absolute delight when it comes to breakfast and brunch classics. I went here for the first time this morning, and the interior instantly charmed me, with its red walls and modern decour, and the waitresses were the most friendly I have ever come across anywhere so far. I was asked if I had ever been there before, strangely, but I was soon enlightened that new customers got a free half-order of their mini-beignets, which further reinforced my good first impression. Beignets are hard to find anywhere outside of the south, and while their mini ones didn't quite stack up to a full-sized beignet, they were delicious nonetheless (though hard to eat neatly with a beard and black clothing, on account of the powdered sugar).\n\nIt was hard choosing what I wanted from their posh and delectable-sounding items, like bananas foster pancakes, chocolate-ganache stuffed waffles, sweet potato waffle, lemon blueberry goat cheese pancakes, cinnamon roll french toast, lobster and brie omelette, chicken and waffles -- on and on. I decided to be adventurous with the unique \"crab cake benedict,\" though, described as jumbo crab cakes served on an English muffin, topped with poached eggs, an \"Andouille-infused\" hollandaise sauce, and served with a side of potatos or grits. I don't often associate fish (except for smoked salmon) with breakfast, and crab cakes are always a risky business anyways (you can either be served a very good one, or else one that gives you the runs six hours later because of food poisoning). \n\nFortunately, there was no fishy business -- the crab cake was tender and went surprisingly well with the poached egg and hollandaise sauce (which had actual Andouille sausage in it, far from just being \"infused\"). The potatoes were acceptable -- a little dry, and my only gripe was that there was ~$1.30 charge extra for them putting cheese and bacon bits on them, which was not made known to me when it was offered while ordering. I'd say you should probably go for the grits instead. At any rate, I will certainly be returning, and hopefully I will have just as excellent an experience as I explore their other options.",

      "text": "The food was disappointing, but the service was decent. \n\nI ordered take out during my lunch and was extremely pleased with how fast I received my food. The actual food however was very disappointing. I ordered the Floridian Omelet with potatoes and English muffin. The omelets flavor seemed to get worse with each bite. The combination of crab and cheese just didn't seem to work together in flavors, at least for me. There was also just a huge glob of cream cheese in the middle. So big that it was room temp at best while the rest of the omelet was hot. I tried to eat it all because It's the most expensive omelet I have ever bought, I just couldn't manage it.  My photos are how far I got. The omelet was big and the egg part of it was wonderful the flavors just didn't seem to go together.\n\nI was extremely disappointed in the omelet. The potatoes and English muffin were good but I didn't receive any condiments for them (I should have thought to ask)\n\nI wouldn't suggest to anyone I know to eat here but I also wouldn't caution them away. For the price and other reviews I have read I was expecting some amazing food but was sadly disappointed.",

So glad we did -- given social distancing -- as that leaves just two intimate booths available. We enjoyed cocktails, dinner salads, stuffed mushrooms appetizer, prime rib entree (requested a lean cut) and salmon entree served Oscar style. Everything was positively top notch and delicious!!\nOur server / bartender, Ryan, was simply delightful -- so friendly and she even gave courtesy chuckles to my hubby's dad jokes! \nLooking forward to dining again at MJ's on our next road trip north!",

      "text": "Definitely the best steakhouse in the area. The prime rib is king, but the ribeye is a close second. I've always loved this place. Classic, dark, has a lodge sort of feel. Desserts change and they bring you a platter to view before you order, which is classy. Mom-Thurs they have early bird specials which include an entree and side. Check those out from 5-6pm. Hade the rare prime rib special, broccoli and added a salad. Delicious! I love it when I order a rare piece of beef and it actually comes out rare. \n\nThis place is always classy. Seemed a little busy during COVID for us, but they clearly were trying. Will always support this classic spot.",

      "text": "Can I give this place 4+ stars ? Like maybe 4.5 stars. They really pulled through on getting us in on Christmas Eve for our reservation. We had been calling for 3 days and it just kept going to an automatic answer, which you could not leave a voicemail on. We tried calling during their business hours after 5pm and again no answer... same auto answer. We finally went online and tried to put in a reservation. Someone called us back the next day and fit us in. The atmosphere is lovely. Several fireplaces, and I love how it has a coat check next to the entrance. This is Lafayette's finest dining restaurant. It was beautifully decorated for Christmas and the atmosphere was cozy. Our waiter told us the restaurant opened in 1977. This place is a classic.\n\nMost meals come with soup or salad. We got the house salad. They used to make it in front of you. Now, instead, you have to tell them what you want on the salad. You can also add bacon and/or mushrooms. Trust me, add the bacon !  They give you plenty and the flavor is amazing ! It's more like finely chopped ham than bacon. They have several house-made dressings. I got the red wine vinegar creamy dressing. Very yummy ! I got the crab cakes to start off.  They were fresh-made, but I think they used the canned crab with alot of breading. The flavor reminded me of a salmon patty. Decent, but not the lump-crab meat patties that I'm used to. My best friend got the prime rib rare. This is supposedly what they are known for. It comes with an au ju sauce and house-made horseradish cream sauce. I also got the largest prime rib. It was 1.5lbs and bone-in steak. The knife I was given was not sharp and they had to trade it out. I guess these are the same ones from the 70s lol. It was good, but even with the replaced knife I had to work too hard to saw into the meat in order to cut it into pieces. My husband got the Ribeye. He had ordered it medium well, but it came out medium. He liked it fine. Definately get the augratin potatoes as your side !  They are cheesy and delicious !!! Another person in our group got the NY Strip. He had ordered it rare and it came out medium well. He sat for quite a while (We were 1/4 complete with our meal) before the waiter finally checked back and then put in an order to replace his steak. The waiter was a bit of a smarty pants. He kind of had an attitude like, .... well I'll work here if I must. Lol  Supposedly, this place is known for their mud pie, but we didn't have enough room for dessert. Total bill was about $100 for 2 people including wine and an appetizer. This is a nice place to have a romantic evening.",

Overall, I do not have any complaints about my dinner at Mountain Jack's. \n\nI dropped by for an early dinner and grabbed a seat at the bar to have a nice, 'romantic' dinner alone. *I'm not sure if I really had a choice with my seating.* The steak menu is pretty vast. Since I had steak the night before, I was debating between the Mahi tuna or pork chop. *When I was a kid, I was told to never order fish from a steakhouse, so I went with the pork chop for this visit.* Before starting, I went for the crabcake as my appetizer. The crab cakes were just ok. I think that I would have preferred them without the dill sauce because the sauce seemed to drown out the flavor of the crab cakes. My main course, the sweet and sour porks chop, was pretty fascinating. After dinner, I was presented with a tray of super-rich desserts, however, I was far too full from dinner to order a dessert. Looking back, I wish that I had skipped the crab cakes so I would have had more room for a dessert. \n\nThe bartender, who also served as my waitress since I was at the bar, was very friendly and prompt.\n\nIf im back in the Lafayette area, I would give Mountain Jack's a second try. I'll just be sure to wear a nicer shirt for my next visit.",

      "text": "I have dined at Mountain Jacks multiple times, typically when Business Associates come into town. We haves dined with family in the main dining room and on my anniversary in the bar area. Stepping into the bar is like going back in time and experience the 50's and not in a bad way. I have never in 8+ visits had a bad experience. You will pay for it in the pocket book so be prepared; it's worth it.\n\nI will update this post with pictures and update the review when I visit again. In the mean time this is currently the only place I send people for the best steak and experience in Lafayette. That's not to say I don't have another go to; but let's be honest, Texas Roadhouse is nation wide and I never recommend that even though I eat it. \n\nC'est si bon",

We loved everything on the sample platter but especially the sauce the shrimp were in. It was like a spicy kind of buffalo sauce but not buffalo sauce. I can't describe it but it was sooo good!!!\nWe all got the table salad not only was it yummy it was actually pretty fun having it made at the table. My daughter doesn't eat red meat so she got the Barramundi fish. I tried it. It had great flavor with a very soft texture. My husband got the porterhouse steak and he said it was the best he's ever had. He eats his med rare so, I didn't try it but he definitely doesn't say something is the best if it's not. I got the ribeye. It was tender with amazing flavor and a nice crisp outside. Loved it! I almost don't have words for their delicious homemade bread. I believe it may be a sour dough. Oh my, this could be dangerous for me if we lived closer! \nI've only eaten at two restaurants in Lafayette. One was East End Grill and now Mountain Jack's. I liked East End Grill...especially their truffle fries but there's no comparison to Mountain Jack's. Mountain Jack's is by far the winner! Their prices were very reasonable as well.",

      "text": "Mountain Jack's provided a relatively quick, filling meal for me and my family on the way home from a trip to Chicago.\n\nIt was A-OK, as my rating denotes.\n\nWe were quickly seated in the restaurant, which looks a lot like a forest lodge with dark wood and fireplaces.\n\nI started with the tableside salad bar, intrigued by what exactly that was. This ended up being the waiter rolling a cart up to the table, on top of which was a platter with lots of cups filled with salad mix-ins. \n\nThe tableside salad bar is a nice touch. Everyone can pick and choose what they want without leaving their seats.\n\nContinuing with the items Mountain Jack's seems to be known for, I chose the prime rib. This is listed as being \"award winning,\" herb crusted and slow roasted overnight. \n\nAnd it was OK -- not the best and not the worst prime rib I've had. It was a little tougher in parts, but the spices on it worked well.\n\nThe rest of my family generally enjoyed their meals. Considering we have a variety of tastes, it was good to find a restaurant we all could find something at. It was also convenient that this restaurant is so close to the interstate.",

We spent a few hours at the restaurant huddled in a booth talking about our conference, life in general and enjoying the far more honest than anticipated conversations that the relaxing atmosphere encouraged. We had amazing tableside salads that Eric suggested and prepared for us. Friendly service, great attitude and he was on top of all our orders! The food was great, service was quick and all orders received were exactly as we hoped (medium, medium rare, etc.). Definitely worth a trip during your visit to the area.

      "text": "Mountain Jack's was a nice place to celebrate a birthday on a Sunday evening. We called a few hours before for a reservation and when we arrived we were greeted with a friendly face and we were asked I a very kind tone what we were celebrating. We were immediately seated at a table with menus and water. We were then tended to quickly and ordered appetizers and drinks. We ordered the cocktail shrimp and the potato skins. The potato skins were decent, kind of hard to mess up, but also didn't seem to have a ton of flavor. The shrimp was prepared well and were served 6 jumbo shrimps. They were good size. The sauce was not spicy enough for us, so we asked for more horseradish on the side. We are in love with St. Elmo's shrimp cocktail and so we like it hot! I ordered the whiskey glazed salmon with garlic mashed potatoes and onion strings. The entrees also came with a choice of soup or salad. The soup of the day was split pea soup with bacon and also offered French onion. I got the opted for the caesar salad and it was alright. The French onion soup was very much so French ONION soup, as there were tons of onion in the soup. I found the soup very sweet and the salad subpar. The  salmon was flaky and cooked well. It was very very salty and ended up scraping most of the glaze off. The mashed potatoes were alright, again not great but decent. The steaks were cooked well and everyone was impressed with the portion sizes for the price. We were also given a complementary dessert since we were celebrating a birthday. They brought us a huge slice of their mud pie and it was delicious. We also ordered a slice of the chocolate mousse pie as well and everyone seemed to prefer the mud pie. We did have an egg allergy and the desserts did have egg. Overall it was nice for Lafayette/West Lafayette.",

For $25 I was able to get a 10 oz ribeye cooked a perfect medium, with a \"Neil style\" topping (hollandaise, bacon, blue cheese, sautéed onions, sautéed mushrooms). It came with two sides plus a salad. That's a lot of food for $25. And it was so delicious, far better than the more expensive fare at the numerous chain steakhouses in the area. \n\nIt's a nice decor. Much more intimate and a bit more old fashioned than the nearby competition. Their bar is stocked with several fantastic bourbons, liquors and craft beer bottles. And I haven't even mentioned the great and polite service. All in all a great find that I'll be sure to revisit. And I still can't get over the fantastic price!",

It's a very spacious location that they've renovated, and it looks very modern and open inside now. \n\nThere are two options when it comes to Taste - hot pot or just regular food. We have yet to try hot pot, but I will update my review when we do. The regular menu is fantastic, however.\n\nWe've tried many dishes here, including a lot of the dumplings, mapo tofu, fried rice, various beef and chicken dishes, and more. I can definitely say my favorite is the beef with scallions; absolutely delicious. The beef is tender, and I love onions/scallions, so it's a homerun for me. The dishes come with rice upon request, and I definitely recommend it. Some of the dishes are definitely on the spicy side, so make sure to ask about that if it's a concern. \n\nService here can be a on the longer side at times, but for the most part, our food has arrived on time. Service staff is very friendly.\n\nThe prices are reasonable, but just be aware that they charge an 18% service charge at dinner, so make sure to note that. (Though if you tip regularly like myself, this shouldn't be a big deal, as it takes the place of the tip.)\n\nOverall, definitely give it a try!",

      "text": "This used to be the old CT Market, which used to have a restaurant quietly tucked in the back, but I'm guessing they didn't want to compete with the New World Market right across the street, so there's an entire restaurant here instead now.\n\nWent here with a friend who doesn't speak Chinese and we got the Peking Duck meal set, Szechuan Wontons, and Snow Pea Leaves. The Peking Duck meal set costs around $40 and comes with either a soup option or a stir-fried option for the excess meat of the duck that doesn't go into the actual Peking Duck. I would say this is among the best Peking Duck I've had in the Midwest, including the likes of Chicago's Lao Sze Chuan, and easily the best in the Lafayette area (much better than the nearby Peppercorn Kitchen and Szechuan Garden). The presentation is wonderful, the meat is rich but thin, and the skin is nice and crispy. The garnishes and sauce are flavorful without being too strong. We got the soup option, which was also nice and hearty, but not quite as spectacular as the main event. The Szechuan Wontons were also some of the best dumplings I've had in a while, with a subtle sweet and peppercorn flavor; my friend was also especially impressed with the dumplings. \n\nThere are two potential downsides that I can see someone experiencing here. First, the items are pricey, especially after the mandatory 18% service charge. I think the food quality was very \"authentic\" and worth the price for the dishes that we ordered and I had the fortune of being able to communicate with the staff in their native language. Unlike a lot of places with foreign staff, they were pretty cheerful and polite and provided decent service. However, this also brings me to my second potential concern. They clearly preferred to converse in their native language, which was somewhat exclusive to my non-speaking friend, so I'm not sure what experience an entire group of non-speakers would have.",

We asked our server about this but she said it's the same thing. I still don't quite believe that, but even if it is true, why does the same dish appear on the menu more than once? Also, the dish we ordered was not supposed to be spicy, but what we got was covered in red and green chillis.\n\nWe were also served by 3 different people who all had to look at the check on our table multiple times to figure out what part of our order was still missing. Despite that,  all three dishes we ordered were served separately, the rice to go with them only came after we reminded them about that and the Appetizer arrived dead last, when we were already pretty much done with the mains.\n\nI usually don't mind patchy service all that much, because after all if I'm not happy with it I can always give a slightly lower tip than usual. But here, an 18% tip is automatically included in the bill. I hate that because it leads to terrible service.\n\nThe place itself is very posh but there was very loud pop music in the background, which was a bit strange.\n\nThe menu is very extensive but it doesn't really describe the dishes, it contains items like \"Beef - 12.95\". \n\nAll of this is a shame because the food itself was not bad.",

After the dishes came, we asked for one dish to be taken back and remade as it was wayyy too salty. But there was no difference and it seemed as though they didn't even make a new dish. The service was definitely not worth a 18% tip.

      "text": "We arrived for dinner on a Saturday evening. There were two other parties in our area when we arrived; one of those parties soon left. The interior is quite nice: lighting, carpeting, flooring, art, and the lay out of the space is quite cozy.  We were, at first, puzzled about why the place was so empty.  We ordered a cheese plate, which took a very long time to arrive, considering there weren't too many other people in the restaurant. The cheese was dry, and the fruit, which included some apple slices, tasted terrible. The apple, literally, tasted like someone had found it on the floor, sliced it up, and brought it out to us with the cheese.\n\nOur other dishes were flavorful, but skimpy and all of the \"hot\" dishes arrived lukewarm.  This place definitely is trying to experiment with flavors, textures, and ingredients, but they just can't get the execution right.  These dishes, also, took a long time to arrive, given that we were the only guests in the dining room who had ordered.\n\nThe worst, though, was the staff.  No one was rude or deliberately unresponsive.  However, several of the staff members were talking very, very loudly about things like drug use, and using a lot of profanity when they spoke. The acoustics of the restaurant were such that it was almost impossible for me to have a conversation with my dining partner, and we could not wait to leave. It was a huge turn-off.  All of the staff with whom we had contact seemed very inexperienced, and from what we could tell (e.g., their very loud conversations), they are college students who are in the job for a paycheck, not because they are interested in hospitality as a career.\n\nVery disappointing, and I'm not surprised that when we left, the dining area was +completely+ empty of guests. This, on a Saturday evening in the downtown area.",

      "text": "Folie presents French-influenced nouvelle(ish) cuisine in a relaxed atmosphere. We were greeted by a young staff that took excellent care of us throughout the night. The wine list is superb for Lafayette, IN with a range of options at different price points. \n\nOur appetizers were pork belly with sweetbreads, and steamed mussels with stilton and pernod. Both were infused with layers of complex flavors. \n\nFor entrees we ordered pork tenderloin with barley risotto in a calvados sauce and a steak with duck fat potatoes. The barley risotto was a perfect complement to the pork and all tasted great in the sauce. The steak was well prepared but was maybe less of a standout by comparison. \n\nDesserts took on more of a molecular gastronomy flair with a deconstructed berry cheesecake that was to die for. We also tried the chocolate panna cotta; the flavors were excellent but the consistency was a little tough. \n\nAll in all, Folie is a strong addition to the restaurant scene in Lafayette with upscale dining, delicious fresh food with innovative preparations, and a well curated wine list.",

      "text": "I visited Folie during the Christmas Parade. Not sure if it was because of the event, but the restaurant was more or less empty at 6:15 on Saturday. A few more parties came in during our meal, but it never came close to filling up.\n\nThe service was excellent. All the staff were kind, friendly, just great at their jobs. \n\nThe menu was small. I appreciate that. I despise large menus. I want to choose from what a restaurant is best at...I don't want to wade through nine pages. \n\nWe ordered a hot appetizer, a cold appetizer and two entrees. Respectively scallop, beet, lamb loin, monkfish/lobster\n\nPrior to any of this we received the bread with truffle oil butter. Not a huge truffle fan, but it was pretty good, so that's a win. The complimentary tasting soup they brought was excellent. Lentil-based, I believe. Very good. Best thing we ate actually.\n\nThe hot appetizer was a single seared scallop. Naturally I don't want overcooked scallops, but this was not cooked in the middle at all. And what I don't get is why this \"seared\" scallop had no coloration on the top or bottom. Not much of a sear-job when there's no color and the inside isn't cooked. The sauce with it was good. The portion was microscopic.\n\nNext was the \"Beets\". Not sure what i expected, but it was various types of beets. Not a beet fan, and these were beets. Need I say more? The beet sorbet was my favorite option. $13 for what amounted to a single beet. Who knew?\n\nMonkfish was just ok. Lobster with it was good. Sauce was decent. Combined it didn't add up to more than the sum of the parts. Was just three different things. Again, small portion.\n\nLamb loin was cooked rare, tasted great, sauce was also pretty good. the meat portion here was ok, the sides were comically small. About two bites of zucchini and two bites of something else. Ridiculous.\n\nWe also had a couple Moscow Mules (they call them something fancier). Those were very good.\n\nThis restaurant has excellent service. I enjoyed my drink. I also thought the entrees tasted good. The serving sizes are very small, especially appetizers. \n\nThis is easily the most pretentious restaurant in Lafayette. The presentation and ingredients of the meals seem to be more important than the taste. $130 for an ok meal is not ok in Lafayette. \n\nFolie seems to have no set menu. I believe the last two restaurants to try that  model in Lafayette were Restauration & Heirloom. Those one-year experiments didn't end well. \n\nI do like the idea of rotating a portion of the menu, but by rolling the entire thing over, you can't appeal to the people who are....*ahem*...boring eaters. There is one in every group (and most couples). If you can't always offer a few items that have mass appeal you're going to have trouble keeping guests coming back in a small city like Lafayette. It would make more sense to me if they were to keep a few broad-appeal, perfected dishes on the menu and rotate the rest. \n\nThis restaurant seems like it would only make sense in a very large city. I don't see it making any sense whatsoever in Lafayette. It's borderline ridiculous, but I wish them the best. I would put the quality of the food on par with Black Sparrow or East End Grill, but at a much higher price point (but also with more weird ingredients)\n\nFood/Price would be three stars, but the service was great and drinks were good, so I felt compelled to go with four stars.",

      "text": "Husband and I dined here last Thursday and LOVED it! Can't BELIEVE such a perfect restaurant has come to Lafayette but, boy, are we grateful! The dining room is understated elegance; special but not stuffy. The service is exactly how I like it: attending to your needs without trying to make chit-chat. You feel cared for but not hovered over. \n\nAnd the food...the FOOD! All ingredients were the best they could be and each dish was prepared, not just thrown together. I had the trout and my husband had the steak; both were excellent and each was tender. We had a hot appetizer and a cold one. The  pickled vegetables were generous and each vegetable had been pickled differently, making a simple offering interesting to eat. The turnip soup recipe elevated this winter root veggie into something you could CRAVE. (I still can't believe I said that about a turnip!)\n\nWe ordered wine by the glass (it was a Thursday) and it was a generous pour.\n\nDidn't order dessert as we were full, but will go hungrier next time so we have room. The words \"chocolate panna cotta\" are calling to me.\n\nThe chef clearly has some big-city skills. We hope locals can appreciate him so he will stay. \n\nOur advice to locals? Forget the Bistro! Don't bother with Pure! Skip the noice at East End Grill! GO TO FOLIE and you'll have a new favorite!",

It was fairly empty when we arrived at 6:30, but by 7:00 it was pretty hopping. \n\nFood was great. I got the salmon and my gf got coq au vin. She clearly had the better dish, but mine was elevated and intriguing, combining unexpected flavors (green beans and pomegranate). I got the better dessert, a deconstructed cheesecake that was fun to work through.

      "text": "There's a new fine dining option in Lafayette, and it's excellent.\n\nI went there with my wife, and liked it so much I took business associates there a few days later.\n\nThe bar is well stocked, with a wine and beer list that's not as big as some in town, but very well thought out. Wine options range from value bottles that would fit the budget of a grad student splurging on a once a quarter I can't stand ramen any more night to a wine aficionado looking for a good Rhone red. The bartender was friendly and knowledgeable without being intrusive.\n\nThe dinner menu was concise and well thought out, a range of appetizers that'd be great to use as \"plates to share\" for a group. The entrees cover the range from beef to seafood to vegetarian. I've tried fried oysters and the pork belly confit. Both were very good, but the pork belly confit was a luscious, perfectly prepared bite of porcine goodness, balanced by a not too tart, not too sweet dollop of tomato jam. Companions raved about the carrot soup and the wedge salad.\n\nAs an entrée, the hanger steak was an excellent piece of beef, prepared (I'm pretty sure sous vide) and seared to perfection. The house pickled mustard grains popped in my mouth, adding just the right amount of bitter and acid to offset the round fatty flavor of the beef.\n\nThe duck breast was likewise very good. Maybe just slightly overdone, but it had juicy, tasty meat with crisp, nicely seared skin and most of the fat rendered out. The sour cherry and hazelnuts added some crunch and a little acid, it'd be the perfect dish with an Oregon Pinot Noir.\n\nI didn't try the scallops myself, but both nights I was there people at the next table raved about them, and they sure looked good. Have to save that for my next visit.\n\nI've tried one desert there, a classic profiterole, or as my mom used to call them, a cream puff. Folie's are fresh made pâte à choux pastries filled with vanilla ice cream and topped with chocolate sauce.\n\nI have only two quibbles. The front of the house staff were friendly and super eager to please, but still learning. I watched our server struggle with a corkscrew and wanted to help her, but she did get the job done. The second is that the salmon on the menu is farm raised. I'm sure that's an effort to keep prices down, but a chef this good deserves better material to work with. Go with Alaskan Kings guys.\n\nOverall, this is a restaurant that would make it in New York or Chicago, but at prices that won't bust a Lafayette budget. Highly recommend!",

      "text": "Over this whole COVID-19 period, we've done multiple deliveries/curbside pick-ups from Sichuan House. I haven't had a chance to try out many other Chinese food places in Lafayette/West Lafayette, except for Peppercorns Kitchen, so I don't have a lot to compare with locally. \n\nTheir service is prompt and only on one occasion did they get our order wrong. Portions are good sized and prices are reasonable. Unfortunately, most of their takeaway dishes come in plastic containers. Hope they'll make changes to that soon.\n\nFood is good. The reason I wouldn't give it 5 stars is because certain dishes have turned out differently to what I'm used to. For example, on two occasions the kung pao chicken had been deep fried. Traditionally (correct me if I'm wrong), kung pao chicken is not a deep fried dish. \nTheir vegetarian mapo tofu is really yum - I'd definitely recommend that. \n\nMy other major concern with their food is that they use a LOT of oil. I usually end up scooping out multiple tablespoons of oil before eating. Please, please cut back on how much oil you guys use. It's pretty nasty.",

They can over do it on the chili oil is the only major complaint in things like the wonton soup or Dan Dan noodles.\nThe other thing is the crab Rangoon is overcooked. The shell is always super hard.

Their eggplant Szechwan is amazing and the hot & sour soup was possibly the best I've ever had. Normally that kind of soup is mainly just spicy, but this was full of all kinds of flavor too. The garlic sauce is light, not the \"American Chinese\" brown sauce kind, so be prepared if you're expecting that; it's very different, though good! The food had a much more authentic Chinese flavor in my opinion.\n\nCons: They got our order wrong so we had to refund/reorder, but they fixed the second batch very quickly. The crab rangoon was ok; it's not as good as some. Probably won't order it again only because everything else was so good by comparison. They also sent no soy sauce, but that might be because I didn't request the driver to get any. \n\nIt's such good food that we would definitely order from there again; I know mistakes happen. Very happy to have tried them!",

Overall I would give the quality of the dish 9/10. It was almost perfect but some of the veggies were not thoroughly cooked so there was a bit of raw vegetable taste (mainly in the onion, I think they threw in the peppers and onions at the same time but onions take longer to cook).\n\nIt was a little pricy at $13, but that was reflected in the quality of the ingredients (Fresh vegetables and good quality pork).

Partially because it's close to Pay Less but also because I like that I can use their own online system and not give away money to third party delivery services.\n\nThe sushi is quite creative. They have a large variety of rolls and options and I think we almost always get maybe 4-5 small rolls and a noodle dish and a starter for a family of four adults. The special rolls are significantly larger in size (usually 6 pieces) while the smaller rolls are 8 pieces and bite sized.\n\nThey also sell Beijing duck at this restaurant that you have to order in advance. It's not truly authentic because the skin is not crispy, but it's still good roasted duck.\n\nI ordered the udon with beef a couple times mostly to make it a fuller meal but it is one of their weaker dishes.",

The miso soup was hot and flavorful. Green onions evident. I had spicy tuna, Boston and shrimp tempura rolls. All were great. Very fresh ingredients and delivered rapidly for a busy dining room. Good value for a nice, not fast food lunch. The menu is extensive. Will certainly want to try it again.",

Unfortunately you do have to go inside as they do not at present offer curbside pick up.\n\nI spoke to Janet/Jeanette over the phone who was a bit curt and seemed to be in a big rush to end the call.\nWe tried the following:\n1) shrimp sumai - this was pretty good albeit a little soggier than I'm used to.\n2) aged tofu - nice big pieces of tofu with yummy sauce on the side\n3) spider roll - I asked how many pieces are in an order of their regular rolls and was told 6, however only got 5 spider rolls. They were not well packed and two of the rolls had come apart (see photos).\n4) spicy girl roll - you get 8 pieces. Very yummy.\n5) Tokyo Chicken - comes with a side of rice and either soup or salad. To be honest, this dish tasted like it had been made a while ago... very soggy and not crispy at all. You are probably better off ordering this if eating in person rather than delivery/pick-up. Good portion! The miso soup was good.\n\nTotal cost - approx $50\n\nOverall the packaging and service was not the greatest but the food is good.\nI would give them another go!",

Not as good as Sushi Don.\n\nAlmost everything was prepared as described but a little on the bland side. Luckily there is chili pepper seasoning on every table. It was the perfect compliment if you like to dial in your spice level and saltiness. \n\nMy wife wasn't terribly impressed with the lunch sushi (spicy tuna & tempura chicken rolls) she said she had had better sushi from a gas station. Now that's sketchy. The chicken karaage were tiny bits of fried chicken that were over done and very dry. On the menu it looks like small fried chicken wings. Once I spiced up my ramen dish it was pretty good. Loaded with too many noodles and shy on broth. To taste the noodles alone, one would not humm with delight. What I mean is it's obvious they are pre boiled in bland water and tossed in at service. I wish the smaller places would take time to bring the noodles back to life within the broth. If anyone can steer me to a place not in Chicago that makes fresh noodles and prepares them properly I would be in your debt.\n\nI gave this a 2.8 out of 5.",

      "text": "A good experience about sums up what you can expect here as a dining experience -- not bad, but not excellent. The interior of the restaurant is pleasant, emulating a modernised/neon-ified Tokyo restaurant, black-stained wood and lacquer off-setting the colourful, glammy lights. The menu has a wide array of sushis, from the simple to the popular Americana rolls you can find in most sushi parlours across the country (Dragon roll, California roll, CC roll, etc.), as well as some other, cooked Japanese fare for those who might not be fans of raw fish, such as a small selection of udon, ramen, bento boxes, and so forth. \n\nI had a fried California roll with a stir-fried chicken yaki udon, and both were nice, though not the best versions I have ever tasted. I also had the \"hot tea\" (ostensibly green tea), and I was a little put-out to find that, however else they prepare the tea, they finish it off by blasting it in a microwave, given that the cup is far too hot to hold at first when they serve you it (which doesn't happen if the tea was heated or boiled on its own, then poured into the cup to be served). The service was a little bit chilly as well -- not rude, just sort of absent-minded or apathetic. So there are a few edges that could be smoothed out a little as far as the food quality and service goes, but, again, it is not bad, and I will definitely return.",

So I called the night before, they graciously took my order when I explained the timing problem and were so helpful.

      "text": "Went here on a Tuesday night with a group of about 12 people. The location is great considering that it shares the parking lot with Payless and other businesses in the area. The restaurant is much bigger than I expected with ample seating space. It wasn't very busy. I had made reservations for this place since I had a big group and they offered us the private room in the back, which is also their karaoke room. I was a bit concerned about a karaoke room in a restaurant, but they assured me that it won't disturb  the other customers. The private room was a big booth, essentially with a TV, speakers, mics and disco lights which doubled up as a private eating space. \n\nThe service was nice. As soon as I entered the room (I was the first person there), the manager came by to introduce himself and give me a lay of the land. He also offered to help me with any requests that I had. Service was prompt.\n\nI got the spicy miso soup with pork. Usually, I gravitate to good sushi and try to stay away from the pork dishes, but I had heard good things about their ramen and wanted to give it a shot. I was very impressed with their ramen. The spiciness was just the right amount of spicy, and the ramen was very flavorful. The meat was cooked beautifully and the egg was made to perfection. A couple of my friends got the same dish and it seemed that the dish was consistent across the board. Prices were decent. For Lafayette, I was very impressed with the whole package. I will definitely be back and maybe next time, try out the karaoke. \n\nVerdict: Get their ramen.",

The Miso Spicy is the answer to cloudy days, rain, hunger, sunny days, fun times, friends, family, it is so good. I always get it and have tried about half the other but none gets me like Miso Spicy. I'm all for the sushi burritos too however they're quite expensive. It's a tidy little campus spot with fun interaction ordering through a robot. There's cubicles that some may enjoy but others will feel confined. Not much window space but good for my sister and I we had it all to ourselves. Glad to have another ramen spot to spread out the space!",

A strong cultured dining experience and huge menu combined with the very friendly service makes this a go to spot in the county for unique and super tasty food.

We went for a takeout thinking it would not have a lot of space for distancing but wish we would have dined in upon noticing how much room is here. Our food was perfectly flavored and went down just like the ideal classic Mediterranean fare of other places I really enjoy like Kebab-G in Peoria, IL. My parents enjoyed some leftovers, quite sure I convinced them without having to say anything!",

      "text": "So confused by the glowing reviews on this place. This was our second time eating there. This time takeout, last time pre-pandemic dine in. Both times we felt the food was lacking. \n\nThe chicken shawarma sandwich was extremely dry and no noticeable garlic flavor. The cucumber salad is more like yogurt with a garnish of cucumber. The spinach pies looked amazing, but were greasy and the cheese to spinach ratio was way off. Needed more cheese for sure. \n\nHummus was fine. Be warned, there is a choice of classic or spicy hummus. The CLASSIC comes covered in jalapeños. So ask to skip them if you have an aversion to spice. \n\nThe sautéed mushrooms was the best dish we had. Nice mix of spices and very flavorful. But in two visits, that's the only thing we'd order again. \n\nWas also disappointed in the level of customer service. When I called to place the order, the person just answered the phone w hello. I had to ask if this was Almadina. Then, at pickup, two server/hostess front of house staff not wearing masks. One was talking to three guests who were leaving, and two of the three guests were not wearing masks. One of the guests had to call the hostess's attention to my presence. When she turned around and saw me, she put a mask on. They must have been friends/family. But you expect a place to follow the signs it has posted on its own doors. And if that's how things are handled front of house, what is happening in the kitchen?",

I realized, even in my burned out state, how absolutely great this restaurant is.\n\nWe ordered the Shawarma plate for two. Oh my lord it could have fed four. And every single piece of meat on that plate is perfectly juicy and tender. The hummus that we ordered with it was smooth and tasty. I loved this meal. \n\nMy son went with the chicken sandwich. I had a bite and was blown away by the flavor of that one. If you are into sandwiches, I would go with this one.\n\nThey accidentally brought us fries instead of rice. This was quickly remedied but I'm so glad they made the mistake. I tried the fries and they are awesome! I mean, I like rice with the Shawarma plate, but if you're into fries, I'd give it a go. \n\nThis has to be one of the top restaurants in Lafayette. If you're driving through like we were, definitely make the stop. If you live nearby, plan to visit weekly. It is that good. One of the best Mediterranean restaurants I've ever been to. This one is an absolute gem.",

      "text": "My wife and I stopped here on the way home from an out-of-state trip. We decided to grab a quick bite and Mediterranean sounded perfect. This The building has tons of room, though when we arrived it was entirely empty, due to the lockdown, which has only started to get more lax.\n\nWe sat and looked over the menu, ordered a sample platter of hummus, baba ganoush, and tabouli, which were brought out shortly with some complementary fresh rolls and a creamy garlic sauce. The rolls were so warm and so fresh, and with the garlic sauce, were truly remarkable. Simple ingredients, but done so well. It was exquisite.\n\nThe hummus was the creamiest hummus I've ever eaten, truly delivious, as was the baba ganoush. I'm not much of a fan of tabouli, more something for my wife, but it wasn't bad either. We ordered our entrees, but I started to think I might not be hungry enough to eat much, once I finished with the amazing bread and dips we already had.\n\nI was already thinking \"five-star for sure\" after the appetizer and garlic sauce, as our entrees were brought out. Unfortunately, that's where the quality diverged.\n\nI ordered a lamb shawarma wrap that sounded right up my alley, with lettuca, tomato, onions, and a tahini sauce that made my mouth water. Once I took my first bite, though, the magic was gone. The tahini was bland; not the usual bursting-with-flavor-sauce I was expecting. The portion I tried only had veggies, which were fine, but just a little plain without the strength of the sauce.\n\nI took a bite with lamb this time, hoping it would save the wrap, but it made it worse. The lamb chunks were ENORMOUS. In a wrap, where I won't be using a fork, they should surely be cut into bite-size pieces, but they were at least two or three times that. It wouldn't be the end of the world, but when I attempted to cut them with my teeth, as one would do with a wrap, the meat was SO chewy. I ended up making a mess, having to drag the chunk of meat out of the wrap and pull it apart with my teeth and hands just so I could get a piece small enough to manage.\n\nThe wrap was a disappointment, probably a 2-star, maybe even 1, because the lamb was also rather unseasoned. The appetizer and complementary garlic sauce/bread was 5-star, though, and I believe it's possible some other entrees here are better than what I had, but if the lamb is any indication of meat in other dishes, I'd be concerned.\n\nPortions were decent for the price, but certainly not my favorite meal I've ever had.",

      "text": "Al Madina Restaurant is an amazing place for a couple to have a quiet dinner or a large group to hold a big dinner. With ample seating enough to fit many, you can find a corner that best suites your liking. The outside of the building has a fresh coat of paint which does not in any means give way to the beautiful middle eastern vibe on the inside. The inside of the restaurant is lightly decorated with decorative rugs, pictures from the Middle East, mosaic sconces, and beautiful mosaic lighting as well. The ambiance on the inside is quite and pretty. It is the new hidden gem on the block! \n\nAt a first glance of the menu, it seems a bit much, there are many options to choose from, and there are lots of different styles of kebabs. So what does one get? Well, my wife and I tried their \"Shish Combo for 2\" in the combo and party trays section of the menu. This was recommended by one of the waiters. Let me tell you, this will NOT disappoint! It was such good tasting food, with big portion sizes for such a good price! At just $30, this tray had 7 pieces of kebab, we chose our two sides of rice and hummus, and we were brought complimentary bread with garlic butter. \n\nMoving from New Jersey/ New York to Lafayette Indiana, I had to be the judge of this restaurant. I went in expecting the food to not be as good as back from the east coast, BUT the food blew my mind. I was VERY impressed with the \"juicyness\" of the chicken, the tenderness of the meat, and the overall taste of the entire meal. From the complimentary bread, to a flavorful plate of whipped hummus, straight to the main entree, the food was delicious. You were able to tell that the bread, hummus, kebabs, and everything was made FRESH to order. I am one who always finishes my meals at a restaurant, but I had to request a box to go for some leftovers. \n\nThe food was amazing, and what about the staff you ask?  The staff is very friendly, and humbled. The waiters that waited on us were actually part owners of the restaurant. The chef had a bit of down time and stopped by our table to see how everything was as well. You definitely receive the vibe of open arms and welcome from the team of people who run this restaurant. \n\nNow, this review would not be complete without me pointing out some of the flaws. The first thing I would want to see is a bit more friendly entrance on the exterior of the building. Maybe some flower pots, or some more color. The inside of the place is beautiful, and some of that culture needs to be brought to the outside as well. Secondly, I wish the music was more in the field of \"middle eastern\" there was casual American songs playing in the speakers, but it just did not fit. Maybe a little middle easter music would complete the restaurant. Other than that, no complaints on the food or the service. \n\nI encourage everyone to go with a friend or your significant other and definitely, definitely try out the \"shish combo for two!\"\n\n*** This review was not sponsored by the restaurant, and I have no affiliations with any member of this restaurant***",

      "text": "My Mom & I went to South Street Smokehouse today for lunch to go (they do not have a dine in option now). My mom is 92 and is hard of hearing.  In accordance with the Indiana Mask Mandate we are not required to wear a mask so that I can communicate to her. As we entered South St. the cashier told me we needed a mask. I said thanks but we have a mask exemption. ANY OTHER business here in town has been nice about this because this is a disability issue. One of the men behind the counter told me we needed a mask. I told him we had a mask exemption and asked if it was going to be a problem to order food to go. He asked another man who told me no they would not serve us. I asked again if they were refusing to serve us given that we had a masks exemption. He said yes and we left. I did not want to embarrass my mom as she had not heard what happened. There were 2 customers in there waiting for their food. We were not a threat to anyone. I sent South Street a FB message because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt that they did not know. (screenshots below of my message, the exemption) and they responded in a very RUDE way. (Screenshot below) \"Please feel free to report the problem. Your moms hard of hearing doesn't justify you not wearing one. Please feel free to never enter MY ESTABLISHMENT again!\" They put up a post a couple of hours later that said they followed the Indiana Mask Mandate. They have now removed that post but I also have the screenshot of it. People that knew me had found out about this were commenting on the post. They have now deleted it. I left a bad review because they could have handled this very differently. I have also filed a complaint with the Civil Rights Division of the US Dept of Justice. I sent them a copy via FB messenger but they have blocked me.\nIs this overkill? ... maybe but the rudeness of the response needs to be addressed. There are people with disabilities that are dealing with this pandemic. Why can't we be kind and help them? Would it have hurt them to let us order food, stand against the wall while we waited and then left? My mama loves BBQ and she was so excited about this but I told her we will not be going back. We will give our business to D&R!",

      "text": "I stopped by South Street on a business trip to West Lafayette hoping for some awesome BBQ. \n\nI will begin this review by saying that I am in love with excellent BBQ, and have been fortunate enough to enjoy some of the best across our great country. I take it very seriously and put a lot of effort into learning what makes great BBQ and how to make it happen. Although my personal BBQ results are varying levels of good, I have had the chance to enjoy what I consider to be excellent BBQ. \n\nThat being said, I was extremely hopeful of a great lunch on the cold January day of my visit. Unfortunately, I left disappointed. \n\nThis seems like a shop that should be able to do it right, and the place was packed during lunch, which makes me think that they are either usually better, or the bar is just not that high, their 4.5 star here on Yelp reinforces my hope that it is the former. \n\nOn to the food. I got my go to that I consider the standard scorecard of good BBQ...Sliced brisket and spare ribs. \n\nI knew I was in trouble as I began ordering. First of all, there was no combo or option on the menu for brisket and ribs, and when I asked for it I was told to buy two lunches, the brisket lunch, and the spare ribs lunch. It wasn't very expensive, just strange. As I was ordering I asked for my brisket to be a half fatty and half lean. The gentleman helping me looked at me like I was asking for something strange. Realizing that maybe they call the cuts point and flat I restated my order as that and got an equally quizzical look. When this happens I lose hope that they speak great BBQ. \n\nSure enough, when my food was ready I received all flat (lean) brisket, although it did have more fat cap than most prefer, so I expect that they believed that is what I meant by half fatty. \n\nThe brisket was very over cooked, when held sideways it broke right in half, which the novice would say means \"it is super tender right?\" Well, over cooked BBQ falls apart easily, but is super dry and loses all of the things that make excellent BBQ magic. The smoke ring was very light and the taste was that of oven roast beef, which is fine, just not great. \n\nThe ribs were dry and bland, they appeared to also be over cooked (no bark, just jerky on the outside) mushy texture. \n\nSides were beans and slaw, I tried a few bites of the beans, but moved on quickly, mainly due to lack of appetite at this point. Not a fan of sweet beans and these tasted like they came from a can, not bad jus not my preference and not special. At some of my favorite places, the brisket beans are my favorite after I finish the main event.  Never tried the slaw. \n\nI hope I caught them on a bad day, regulars would know better. \n\nRibs - 3/10\nBrisket 3/10\n\nNot a 1 star, but well below average.",

The food was decent I had BBQ chicken which was really good, the corn bread is a little corn tasting and they didn't have honey that was not expired so it made it taste a little off. The potato salad was really good. They have a few flavors of BBQ sauce they were all pretty good really. The people working didn't look like they wanted to be there which I mean nobody wants to be at work but a smile never hurt nobody. All in all it was OK at best.

Explain it well in their reviews.  How can you call yourself a smoke house when you don't smoke anything??  Brisket tasted like dry roast beef, 1/4 dark chicken was mushy and had no flavor, certainly never spent any time in smoke.  Or it was held in a steam table so long it lost all flavor?  If you like to add lots of sauce, their sauces are pretty good, but $25 for two lunches is way over priced for what it is.  I also have been to many BBQ joints, I can't understand how the other reviewers can say they've been to great BBQ joints and put this place in the same category.",

The boys loved the braised beef noodle soup with James claiming it was \"the best soup ever!\" The gyoza and spring rolls were yummy too. I was pretty disappointed in the Dan-Dan noodles. They were really basic and one dimensional and had an unfortunate texture from using peanut butter in the sauce. We went with a large group, and I think others liked their noodle dishes- pad Thai and lo mein got decent reviews from friends.",

      "text": "This place was super cute and convenient. It's located where Maru Sushi was before it moved across the street, and though the look may have completely changed, Noodles & I managed to keep the initiate, tucked away, almost cafe-like vibe. It's now a lot lighter and has a clean aesthetic to it.\n\nSolid Asian noodle place with Japanese, Chinese (Cantonese, Beijing Sichuan), Taiwanese, Korean, Thai, and Singapore flavors. A+++ on variety! Completely different from Noodle and Company, and I feel like the flavor profiles are so different that there's no competition (there is). Service was quick, place has a very clean feel to it. Excellent for date night, friends night out, the aftermath of breakfast club, and late night study sessions. Especially because it's just around the corner from study spots like Vienna and Greyhouse. REALLY good for winter nights or when you're getting a quick, sit-down lunch between classes or work (and Maru Sushi is too full). Won't lie, this isn't the best place for vegetarians or vegans. Most of the dishes have some sort of meat. There are definitely more options if you're a pescetarian, as there's a good number of seafood options. However, it's first rate from anyone lactose-intolerant or allergic to milk.\n\nMy first time, I came here with my club's treasurer for a late dinner on Monday (Maru Sushi was closed). It was definitely steered more towards an Asian crowd. While I excited at all the options like the fried udon, roast duck noodle, and the Dan Dan noodles, my friend (I'd only introduced him to Panda Express, Yummy Time, Maru Sushi, and Basil Thai by that point) was very confused. I ended up ordering the Singapore Mee Fu and he got the Braised Beef Noodle. I was REALLY happy with my Singapore Mee Fun, as it had been the year after I'd lived and worked for a couple of months in Singapore. After my time there, I missed the unique flavors from there and this made me really happy. However, my friend was really confused because Taiwanese Braised Beef Noodle soup apparently doesn't taste anything like American beef noodle soup. The way the beef was cooked confused him, the noodles confused him, and he kept asking why they put a whole egg in it. Overall though, he didn't hate. So just heads up for if you or a friend you want to bring are not as familiar with Asian cuisine. I encourage anyone to visit if they have time!",

There's definitely a lot of flavor in these dishes in respect to that OTHER noodle place. For my first time visit I got the Vietnamese Pho with beef. There's a handful of pho options, but you gotta go with the Vietnamese one right. My bowl of pho was a large, expected size, but very easy to consume for a lunch. It came out quickly, piping hot. It was a little on the salty side, but all in all, that's some good lunchtime pho. PHO-NOMENAL!\n\nMy friend got the pad thai, and he was also pleased with his meal. I will be coming back to try other dishes for sure. Places like this need the business. Plus it's got a nice sit-down restaurant feel, but you just order and pay up front and then leave when you're done. That's bonus convenience worth expressing.\n\nNoodle & I?

      "text": "Fantastic campus vibe without the old fashioned run down walls or tacky interior, all new here! The Tap offers outdoor seating, generous and well thought out inside, a meager yet smart menu, local brews, and a solid friendly staff. Be prepared, there are 70 on tap drips! Easy to get confused! Needs a better way to organized, hopefully there's easier ways to figure out what to order online soon! Will definitely be back and try more things, everyone in our group enjoyed their meals except some had minor niggles more for their own tastes I thought than actual issues. The Black & Blue burger is amazing. Tatter tots appetizer rocks socks. An easy option for adult campus dining, glad to see the first floor of Rise put to good use.",

      "text": "This is one of my new favorite spots at Purdue. I actually like that they have a restriction for 21+ years old only since it is a tap restaurant. It's like a nice place for upperclassmen at Purdue to gather while still having a great place to bring your parents when they come to visit.\n\nI have had a different variety of their menu since they've opened and I've loved every item, even the salads (which sometimes aren't the best at other grill and burger places). You really need to try the truffle parmesan dip for your fries as it's the best dipping sauce I've had.\n\nThe customer service is great and they always have a beer to recommend when you are trying to figure out what to try. It's even better that they have free sample sizes so you aren't stuck with a whole beer that you don't enjoy! The only problem I've run into here is the music is excessively loud. It's hard to hear your friends or family that are sitting right across from you.",

The friendly customer service dude told me I could come in to pay (which sort of surprised me, because I thought businesses were only doing curbside right now). I explained to him that I am OLD af, so he said he would bring it out to the car. \n\nTen minutes later, I pulled up, showed him my ID, signed the CC receipt and he loaded the beer into my car. I wasn't thrilled about having to sign the CC receipt, sort of wish they would try to figure out a way to not make people sign during this virus thing. He told me they had been cleaning the pens between each transaction though.\n\nThe beer (Bionic Dragon Blood Orange) was delicious and super fresh. Looking forward to the pandemic fading away and enjoying beers (and food) at the Tap again soon. In the meantime, curbside is the way to go.",

      "text": "The Tap menu features something so useful, so simple, and so utilitarian that I simply can't believe that this is the first time that I've come across it. With two pages of beers brewed in-house, determining what to order could prove confusing if you had to go off of names and descriptions alone. Obviously, the types of brews are listed as well, which helps, but there is also a small Cartesian graph with Sweet/Bitter on the X axis and Dark/Light on the Y with the type of beer plotted. This is GENIUS! \nBetween the striking number of quality-sounding beers listed and my appreciation for their menu ingenuity, I'm already feeling very favorable toward The Tap. \n\nI mentioned the large selection of beers, both their own and many others on tap as well as some 1700 in bottles or cans. There are also ciders and a few other brews, but there is limited wine and no liquor, so don't come in looking for cocktails. You'll be able to find something that you'll enjoy if you even marginally like beer.\n\nOr good food. I didn't mention the food yet, which is excellent! Appetizers, entrees, desserts? Got it all and everything has great flavor!\n\nService was also amazing! Our server was a former bartender who knew the answer to everything we asked as well as being quick and friendly. \n\nThe space is large, with lots of pub tables, booths in the back and a long, winding bar that sits below a small stage for live acts that looks over the two rooms. TVs are present, but not overwhelming, thankfully. Rather, the many paintings of sports or the foot traffic outside seen through the two walls of windows distract the eye more than anything. \n\nIf you enjoy beer and good food, I highly recommend The Tap!",

We ordered the chips and queso and fettucini alfredo with chicken. The queso was delicious! The queso had a perfect blend of all the right flavors. There was even a hint of bacon in the queso. I thoroughly enjoyed the chips and dip. The dinner rolls were super fluffy, buttery, and moist. The pasta was delicious but very greasy. The greasiness of the pasta was pretty off putting. Also, we waited a really long time to get our food despite how few people were in the restaurant. Overall, the food was great and I highly recommend.",

We both ordered drinks to start; I ordered the blueberry lavender mojito. It ended up being too strong and I asked our waiter to add a splash of lemonade, which made it so much better! We then ordered the chips and queso appetizers share and WOW! It was AMAZING!!!! The chips are homemade and came out so hot and fresh. I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone who dines here. My friend ordered the fettuccine alfredo pasta and I ordered the asian chicken lettuce cups. We both liked our food! I kind of expected my lettuce cups to be assembled already, but it came as a spread that I assembled myself. This was fine as well, just a little messy to eat! The peanut sauce that comes with it is the perfect flavor for this dish! The only problem overall was the ceiling slowly dripping on my friend throughout our meal... We think this was because of how hot and humid it was outside. Otherwise, it was a great experience! Our waiter was very kind and attentive!",

The menu has a lot of good options for a lot of different types of eaters. \n\nWe got the shrimp and feta pasta, risotto, salmon, and truffle Mac & cheese. They all came with salads, which came with a great mango chardonnay dressing. We were served complimentary bread & butter before our meal. The shrimp & feta pasta was my favorite, it was a great twist to the different cheesy pasta options, and it had little tender chunks of pork belly in it as well! The risotto was the most disappointing, but we still ate most of it. Truffle Mac and cheese came with lots of lobster, which was pretty delicious! The salmon was flaky in a good way, and it came with crispy potato medallions in a pool of guacamole. \n\nOverall? A great restaurant to enjoy good food with good company.",

      "text": "I really enjoyed the Pecan Chicken Rollup.  Not too filling for a lunch time meal and the taste was excellent.  The chicken tenders were breaded in crushed pecans, deep fried, and then wrapped in tortillas with a Honey-lime sauce, tomato, & lettuce for a great combo taste of sweet & savory with a bit of crunch.  \n\nI chose fries to go with the wraps and they were a bit disappointing.  There were plenty of the shoestring variety, but they were cool and chewy like you get when they sit out under a heat lamp.  I don't know for sure, just that they reminded me of those disappointing ones.  \n\nThe place has a really nice ambiance and I was served promptly, but it was a little weird sitting at the bar for lunch and then the bartender disappeared for the entirety of my meal.  My service was picked up by a waiter, but it felt really odd being the only one seated there and nobody on the other side of the counter.  Made it seem like I wasn't getting noticed since my waiter was only in the bar area sparingly.  Still, he did a good job of getting the food out and bringing my check.  Just would have been nice to have him check on whether I liked my food or needed a refill on my water before I was finished.\n\nBut the entree was excellent, so I will let that skew my rating higher than I might have otherwise given.\n\nReview #1534",

The interior reminds me of a classy, old school dinner-date restaurant that really makes for a nice fancy-ish ambiance. The server I had was very attentive with drink refills, orders, and check ups. The food was amazing too! I had the shrimp risotto that a very unique creole style with pork belly and mushroom flavors folded into the creamy risotto and shrimp. My date had the shrimp fettuccini which she also really enjoyed. The price per person is about 30-35 with drinks which is on par with the quality of the service and food. Certainly will be coming back in the future!",

Yet, the Very Delectable Mrs Funk and I find ourselves here on a Friday eve for a Greyhound pickup of Ms Baseball Funkette away from her Wrigleyville Party Barn for a Sunday Indy event.\n\nAs is our way, where Funksters meet, dinner is near. And Red Seven was as close as a crosswalk.\n\nTall smokey glass outside windows, wooden paneled, sectioned off booths to one side. Shiney-glassed mirrored bar back with hightop fours behind the bar seating. At 8P in a Big 10 town, the joint is... empty! Ah, it is spring break. We chose a Hightop and service was prompt. How could it be anything but.\n\nSignature cocktails Gin and Sin Martini, Cool as a Cucumber chiller and a Grayson Pinot Noir, all at $8 per, start the conversation. A southwestern grilled chicken salad $10, chorizo stuffed empanadas $8 and asian veggie egg rolls $8, round out the shareable evening nosh. Before you can say March Madness, plates of fresh prepared groceries are delivered to the tall table. Delicious satisfaction followed...along with a repeat of the conversation starter.\n\nIn my usual close, would we return? Well with a nod to 1960 and Mr Elmer Bernstein one might say this was the Theme to the Pretty Darn Good Red Seven.... know what i mean?",

I ordered the 1 for the spice level and my boyfriend ordered 2. \n\nIt took over 40 minutes for us to get our food. The fried chicken lacked breading.  It was flavorful, but definitely not what we were expecting.  It really tasted like seasoned chicken, not fried chicken. When the ramen came out, we were disappointed.  It looked like one had more hot sauce/oil in than the other so my boyfriend and I switched, assuming his was the one with more sauce/oil.  The server failed to mention which was which. She seemed confused. \n\nThe pork was rubbery - I wish that it was grilled a little more.  The broth was okay, a little bland.  I noticed other tables got different seasonings to add, but we were only given pepper. \n\nOverall, I don't think i'll be returning.  While, it's closer to campus, I do favor the other ramen restaurant more.",

      "text": "A much cuter place than I was expecting with terrific ramen and a homemade broth with extremely rich depth of flavor. I was impressed by this place since it is quite close to Purdue University's campus but it doesn't feel like a cheap college restaurant. There's a substantial amount of seating, and the place was fairly busy on a Friday night when my friend and I went, but we were seated instantly. \n\nThey have eight ramen options, but all are pork-based and the only meat option is pork belly. I don't normally like pork belly, but it was homemade here and it was fantastic! Of the eight ramen options, four are not-spicy, and the other four are the same as the first four, just with the option of 3 levels of spicy. Both my friend and I went with the spicy tonkotsu shoyu ramen, level 2 spicy. The ramen was served with noodles, fish cakes, a hard-boiled egg, pork belly, seaweed, scallions, and mushrooms with ramen pepper at the table. It seemed like the spicy factor came from the amount of chili oil they added to the ramen, which is a bit like a ripoff since the spicy ramen costs a dollar more than the regular ramen for just a bit of spicy oil ($11 for regular, $12 for spicy). While it didn't feel worth the extra dollar, I think the spicy factor was a great addition to the meal. \n\nPlease note that they don't have a license for alcohol yet, so your options are water, soda, and tea. They also have a list of appetizers/meals like edamame, tempura veggies, and chicken katsu on their menu. Overall, a great place to warm up and eat some great ramen!",

      "text": "I was excited when I found out there was a new Ramen place, especially one near campus. The first time I went there on a Sunday evening, they told me there was a 40 minute wait. I wasn't going to wait that long, so I came back on a very late evening on a weekday, around 8 ish. It was empty, but yet I had the slowest service ever. There was only one person working at the cashier and also serving everyone in the restaurant....so I was ignored for the longest time because she was so occupied at the cashier.\n\n20 minutes later, got the food and oh dear....\n\nThe shio ramen was so bland. The broth was almost tasteless and there was only one very thin slice of meat....it was a really sad experience. It's like they watered down the broth until it's completely tasteless.\n\nIf you get the spicy one for a dollar extra, they dump some chilli oil in it and call it spicy...you can literally see the pool of oil on the top of the broth (also only on one side of the bowl)\n\nWe also tried the \"fried\" chicken....it doesn't even have any breading on it...and the spicy version is just drenched in oil. Nowhere close to what a proper karaage should be like...\n\nOverall, absolutely not worth the money for the quality of food and be prepared to wait forever to get your food.",

      "text": "Lovely little mom and pop Ramen shop. Atmosphere and decor are very charming, the kitchen is open which is fun to watch and there's other dishes to choose if you don't want Ramen. The Ramen is good, but limited in variety. There's another Ramen shop downtown which I think I like better for noodles, but where Denju really gets me is their Curry Katsu and their rice bowls. Their curry is so good, and really hits the spot on a cooler day. Rice bowls are very hearty and filling with a good spread of options. The Chicken Karaage is delicious too. The chunks of chicken are very juicy and don't get dried out and bland when fried, and the fry coating is very tasty (spritz some of the lemon juice from the lemon garnish). They claim to make their broths from scratch, which I can believe as there's a little variance from the bowls I've had at different times. Which I kind of like, makes it feel less process and manufactured. \n\nI've seen a few reviews about service, which I think are pretty unfair. Every time I've been, it's been the same staff. And I'm just speculating, but it looks like a family run place, with 1 server. Looks like mom and pop in the kitchen and the daughter running front of house. Could be way off base, but I've never had a disgustingly long wait (typically in and out in 40min), and they're beyond nice. They're all very sweet and smile brightly when you leave and say thank you, even when it's busy. Something to be said about a staff that treats you as a human instead of a dollar sign.\n\nIf you want an authentically fast Ramen shop, try Yata across the river. If you want a nice place to have a conversation, enjoy the atmosphere, and have some warm comfort food that was lovingly handmade, give this place a shot.",

      "text": "Midwest Seafood Boil is the alter-ego of No. 2 Asian Kitchen... and the sign outside says \"Rice Cafe\". Identity confusion aside, this is a little treasure of a Chinese takeout place. The Chinese half of the menu has all sorts of unique finds, mixed in with a comprehensive menu of old standby's. The star of the show, though, is the seafood boils. We had the crayfish boil, and it was absolutely delicious. The portions were very generous, and the flavor was amazing. We asked for spicy, and they delivered! It's only been around for a couple of months. We're hoping that they can stick around for the long haul! Great addition to the Purdue area restaurant scene.",

      "text": "I love poke!  And I really appreciate that this restaurant opened at 10 a.m. so that I could grab a bite to eat at 10:30 without having to kill time waiting around. \n\nI have had poke at several places around Indy, so I was pleasantly surprised when the regular size bowl was about 2 cups instead of the massive bowls I've had elsewhere.  I had a lot of things to do and didn't need to feel stuffed!  \n\nI didn't see any \"pre-conceived\" options on the menu board behind the counter, so I just followed the order and direction from the server on building my bowl.  Size then rice type (brown) were followed by protein choice (Ahi Tuna).  After that, they have a no limit choice of add ins and some that were an additional $.50 per selection (avocado and pineapple).  You also get a choice of sauce (Eel) and a couple toppers (lobster salad and shrimp).  I declined adding more toppers since by bowl was already overflowing.\n\nThe only negative I see is that when the bowl is filled, it is hard to stir it all up to get a blending of flavors until some of the bowl is consumed.\n\nI also don't know why there have been so many comments about the expense.  If you want fresh food, hand prepared, it will cost more than a burger joint.  And frankly, I found the regular size perfectly fine for lunch (and I had just walked four miles followed by another six that afternoon.)\n\nI really enjoyed my meal and highly recommend it to anyone who wants a healthy and fresh alternative for lunch.\n\nReview #1134",

Pretty low quality rice. There was a lot of salmon which is awesome but it had very little texture and flavor.

      "text": "I was at Purdue for a conference, and stopped in for a quick weekday lunch at Poke Hibachi.  The service is indeed quick -- fast casual, order at the counter style. It's very small inside, so you may not find seating if they're busy. \n\nMy friend and I split a large poke bowl (around $13 including tax and a 50 cent up-charge for adding avocado), and it was enough food for a decent meal for two people, which was a great value.  They sell hibachi (cooked proteins -- mostly meat or fish -- with veggies and rice), as well. You can choose from a variety of raw and cooked seafood proteins, and there's a tofu option for vegans/vegetarians.  The food was fresh and tasted good -- standard tasty poke bowl fare, with lots of good options for sauces and toppings.\n\nThe portion was almost too generous for the size of the bowl I had -- I asked for a mix of brown rice and greens as a base, and was given so many greens that the bowl was basically impossible to mix: you need to eat all the good toppings off first, and are then left with plain rice and lettuce at the bottom. I'm not complaining about big portions; it was very generous. But it might be better in a larger bowl.\n\nSpeaking of bowls: there's no recycling container (at least as far as I could see), in spite of the fact that all of the bowls used are plastic and presumably recyclable. \n\nBonus, though: the chopsticks are smooth and rounded, unlike the rough-edged, stuck together wooden chopsticks most places have.  No splinters here!",

The meat was appropriately thick and the breading was the right \"weight\" -- not too light, not too heavy. More critically, it wasn't soggy or overly oily. The sandwich itself is massive. We split it between the two of us and were full. I'd strongly recommend adding their bistro sauce to the tenderloin.\n\nAdditionally, we also got the fried green beans and buffalo chips. Both were pretty good, although I'd personally get the green beans over the chips.\n\nOverall, this is totally worth the (short) drive from Lafayette.",

We were there after a Purdue game and it was clear this was a \"place to be\" for those in the know (this place is not exactly close to the stadium). \n\nTC's is a \"common ground\" meeting place for folks of all kinds - we saw young hipster foodies and old-timer regulars; a group of guys kicking back with some beers and a girls-night-out birthday party in heels and high makeup;  an alternative couple with tattoos and piercings, and a buttoned-down family with young kids. Everyone was just there to enjoy the food and the place. \n\nThe best thing: These folks know how to season and cook a steak! We had the strip and the filet, each medium rare. The strip was miraculously medium rare from within a millimeter of the seared edge all the way through. Unbelievable. Maybe the best steak this seasoned steak eater has had any where, any time. The filet was super flavorful, also right to temperature. Not the most velvety I've ever had, but definitely the most flavorful. Also very much recommended: the sauteed mushrooms!\n\nThe wine selection is limited but we found something we liked. Our one critique seems to be common around here where there is an apparent preference for corn-fed beef, which we struggle to understand as well-aged Western beef fans. In the end it's a small matter - especially since these folks really know how to cook a steak!",

My wife looked on On Yelp for a place to have lunch and came across TC's. Caroline was our server (and she was beyond excellent) and every single expectation for a family of 5 to get a decent lunch was far exceeded... The food was delicious, the restaurant was neat and clean and we received quite possibly the best service we have ever received at ANY restaurant (high-end or otherwise). I'd like to brag again on Caroline and say that I wish every business had team members like her. She made us feel completely at home, did more for us than any server we've ever had had done and had a genuine smile on her face the entire time.

It was recommended to us by a local and it did not disappoint. \n\nWe tried both the breaded tenderloin and the BLT. The tenderloin was huge! It had a nice balance to sandwich. It was not chewy or overly moist, but just the right amount of both. My coworker got the side salad and it was your standard side salad. \n\nThe BLT was very tasty and had a good proportion of ingredients. The bacon was crispy and on the thicker side. I really liked the buffalo chips, which were like flattened Arby's curly fries in their flavoring and they had a good crunch to them.\n\nThe place was packed when we got in there for a late lunch. It seemed like somewhere the locals hang out a lot. Good place if you are every in the Battleground, IN area. \n\nThey have a daily special that is $6.50 and it seemed like everyone but us was getting the chicken and noodles that are the Wednesday special.",

      "text": "I happened on this place totally by chance. I was lost and cruising the Indiana countryside on a trip back from Chicago.  I hit this little country restaurant and bar about 4 PM on a weekday, with already 30 or 40 cars in the parking lot.  \n\nMore out of curiosity than hunger or thirst, I stopped in to see what the fuss was about. Before I knew it, I was watching these gargantuan meals come out of the kitchen from my barstool perch: huge steaks, massive cheeseburgers, even massive salads, accompanied by a LOT of smiles when the plates were laid down. \n\nI ordered a fried pork tenderloin sandwich, an Indiana state dish if there ever was one. What came out was a tenderloin the size of my plate (see photo). And my plate was a full dinner plate, which was completely covered by the Paul Bunyan-esque sandwich. \n\nNow that I'm reading the other reviews of TC's, it's clear that all their food is oversized, well-prepared and relatively inexpensive.  By the time I left at 530, the place was jammed up, completely packed, and loaded with laughter and good conversation. \n\nI'm going back to this little gem of a throwback Indiana pub and restaurant on my next trip to Chicago, and I'll make sure to order a steak or a cheeseburger, which looked good, as did everything else.  And Craig the burly bartender will remember me, as he was duly impressed that I ate every single morsel of my Andre the Giant Tenderloin. And a small plate of shrooms.",

It and Basil Thai have the same owner, and they have pretty much the same thing. However, Thai Essence's menu is more extensive than Basil Thai. Both do take-out, but no delivery. Additionally, I find portions at Thai Essence are bigger than at Basil Thai.\n\nMy favorite by far is that Thai Essence has a section called Hot Plates. More often than not have the Duck Pra Ram or the hot plate that has lychee, but honesty everything is good here. This is the foremost place I take people if they haven't gone there before. It's more upscale, an actual restaurant versus a mom & pop shop.\n\nIf you're looking to impress someone, whether it's on a date, an interview, business meeting, alumni, or family, this is the place to go. And IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLACE FOR PEOPLE WHO'VE NEVER EATEN THAI FOOD BEFORE. You're sure to be in for a good experience. The portions are HUGE, especially if you get the curry pineapple fried rice (hugely popular). \n\nIt's a classy place. Seriously, this is the go-to place I recommend and make reservations to for when friends' have family coming over they need to show off to or visiting speakers/trainers for club. I would recommend dinner. Again, more extensive menu. And pretty much any of the desserts.\n\nBUT DON'T BE FOOLED, YOU CAN DRESS CASUAL. It's definitely more upscale, but the prices are pretty much the same and it's good for all occasions. So while you do have business men and women, advisers, counselors, and families coming in and out, you can definitely slum it as a college student and it's just fine. My club was the Bujinkan Yanagi Dojo, a martial arts club. We would sometimes take our speaker/trainer there after seminars, and almost everyone would come in training duds.Staff is cool like that and attentive.\n\nThey do reservations, but it tends to be more immediate. As they're more than a bit out of the way, walk-ins are easier with them. However, they're popular enough that if there is some big event going on, reserve early. They don't do 6 months ahead early, but one or two months ahead should suffice. They're REALLY good for large parties. Unlike Basil Thai, they have the room. Aforementioned seminar crowd had about 12 (walk-in) and I took a family of 7 (reservation) there another time. Both times, we fit comfortable in the back.",

So, if you're looking for a Cafe Rio substitute, this Mexican restaurant might fit the bill. \n\nThe rice here is not my favorite, but it's not NOT good -- it just tastes like instant rice. They only have one type of rice option here (cilantro lime), but I wish they would consider also offering Mexican rice. \n\nThe ordering system is set up like Chipotle, in that you tell them what you want (burrito, tacos, nachos or quesadilla), and then you can customize it however you want. Protein offered is shredded chicken, shredded beef, pork barbacoa, grilled chicken and grilled steak. You can also get your meal vegetarian (which does not come with a protein). \n\nBecause this restaurant is located near Purdue University, it can get pretty busy with students filtering in and out. Also, there isn't much parking on the street. We ended up parking in the parking garage located across the street from the restaurant.",

      "text": "I was disappointed in Fiesta. Maybe I was expecting too much from the high Yelp rating, or was it an off-day for the ingredients? I ordered one of the most popular items, the chicken burrito - enchilada style - with the cheese and sauce on top. To start, Fiesta makes their own tortillas in the store, cooked on a circular flat top. Pretty cool! The ingredients looked fresh, service was fast, and the staff were friendly. I stopped in for an early lunch, and by the time I left the line was 15+ deep. This place obviously has a following. \n\nThe final product looked good but suffered from several problems. First, the tortilla was doughy. I don't know if it was undercooked or too thick, but it was like chewing a mushy washrag. Second, the rice was too wet, soaking the tortilla even more from the inside. Third, the chicken, beans, and rice filling were not hot enough. I ended up discarding the wet tortilla and scooping up the ingredients with my high-priced side order of chips.  I thought the Diet Coke was flat. Overall 2.5 stars.\n\nWhat are best in class items here? If they can get the tortillas cooked right, I think that is a big draw, and the salsa is very fresh and tasty. The lettuce was good too. I'll give Fiesta another try sometime, but I won't go out of my way for a repeat visit.",

I was really impressed with Bowen Bistro's quality of ingredients for the price.\n\nI know there are some not great reviews, but I think when you go, you need to take your server's recommendations. We ordered an appetizer and asked her if it was good, and she said it was ok. She was right, it was just ok. However, we ordered her two favorite dishes, the crispy skin salmon and the aged NY strip, and they were DELICIOUS. You would pay about 30% more for the same quality of ingredients elsewhere. The crispy skin salmon is one of the best things I have eaten at any restaurant ever including restaurants in Chicago, San Francisco, NYC, New Orleans, etc. The mashed potatoes are so good we ordered an extra side.\n\nWe will definitely be back. Oh my goodness, and the bourbon cake and tiramisu are incredible. I was surprised they were handmade. I can't wait to go back and try the duck, and of course, get the perfect crispy salmon again!",

We started with an appetizer of the Ahi Poke, which was a really flavorful bite before digging into our main dishes. For our mains, I had the Unadon, which was really tasty, but also really beautifully prepared as you can see in the photo. My partner had the Wagyu Gyudon which was a really warm, comforting dish. \n\nOne of the best moments of our experience was Bowen's pleas to try the marble soda. I had never heard of it, so I was kind of reluctant to try it. But Bowen was so excited and proud about serving the \"good stuff\" and brought out a bottle to kind of show us what it was all about. We got a bottle and it was certainly worth it. If you go, you really do have to try it. \n\nAt the end of the day, you can really feel Bowen's heart in the food and the experience. It was the highlight of our day.",

I get the Asian fusion thing, but there are also standouts on the menu that seem way out of place (New Orleans salmon, Spaghetti and meatballs). \n\nUpon entering, there is a marquee that says \"Fine Dining\"; however places that are actually fine dining, don't need to announce it. On the table, the salt and pepper are cradled in a kitschy chef character. Not a problem, but not fine dining.  \n\nThere is a section called crepe omelets, I asked what makes them crepe and the server said, they are just omelets. No problem, but why include \"crepe\" in the name. \n\nI had the wagyu omelet ($16), it was really tasty. Their dishes are stand alone, which I am fine with, but there are no al a carte sides that you can order. \n\nBowen (the chef/owner) came out to greet us, which is a nice touch. He's a young guy and really nice! I hope he can lose the seriousness of the restaurant and just make it young and fun like him! Lean into the kitsch!",

My son was done his meal before mine came out, and then I was almost finished before the next 2 meals came out. And some of the food was cold while others were hot. The food was actually good, but the kitchen needs a lot of work to run smoothly. Not an enjoyable experience.",

The Hawaiian Avocado Tartare was creative and refreshing;  the Sukiyaki Wagyu Gyudon was an ultimate comfort food on a cold day; the Truffle Four-Cheese Ravioli was creamy and tasty. The service was okay, but some things remain to be worked out. Don't tell a table you can't do something \"because you expect so many more people to come\" (they never did show up).  Unfortunately, it is right now not a restaurant I plan to take visitors to (given the prices, it needs Purdue visitor business). The setup with two unprotected doors that let cold air in, the lighted billboard over the bar,  windows all around with most of them looking at a gas station and people pressing their noses against the glass, make the environment uninviting. Some of these issues can be addressed and hopefully they will.",

We shared the truffle waffle fries with garlic aioli appetizer and all members of my family loved it. My daughter had the chicken Marsala. She loved it; it came with a delicious side of buttermilk mashed potatoes and puréed cauliflower (which he made on one of the Master Chef episodes last year as well). My wife had a zucchini pasta dish that was light and tasty. We all shared two of the desserts ( Black Truffle Hazelnut Mousse Cake and Red Velvet Mousse Cake) which were very good but less amazing than the entrees. Reasonably priced for the high quality.",

The Gyoza was good; but, when it came to our entrees, there was a lot left to be desired. The chicken in the omelette and wrap tasted extremely processed (like McDonald's consistency). The salmon and the shrimp that accompanied it, were both undercooked and under-seasoned. Additionally, the dishes were served one at a time with a 20-minute lag between the first and last dish -- resulting in the initial dishes being cold. Dishes were overpriced given the quality of food. We had high expectations; hopefully they can turn things around quickly.",

It was bittersweet to hear that this new Korean restaurant opened up in the exact same location, but I'm glad I tried this place out anyways because everything was SO DELICIOUS. I was the only customer there because Purdue was on winter break, but I'm curious to know how busy this place is going to be during the school year. (Let's hope they do reservations)\n\nOrdered the Dol Sot Bibimbap (rice, meat, veggie & egg in a stone bowl) and LA Galbi (beef short rib with bones), and they were both perfect. And yes, they serve Banchan (medley of tiny side dishes). Their seaweed soup was also very flavorful and delicious.\n\nCan't wait to come back and try the Hae Mul Pa Jeon (seafood savory pancake), Bul Go Gi (marinated beef) and grilled pork belly because those are also staples! The interior was also remodeled and has that cozy-yet-chic farmhouse feel. The servers were very polite and attentive, and I enjoyed listening to K-Pop while I basically inhaled my meal. SO GOOD.",

I ordered the bibimbap in a stone bowl, which allowed me to scrape the bottom for those crunchy bits of rice. However, the flavor was a bit lacking in my opinion. The complimentary miso soup was a surprise on a chilly day, and also quite tasty. I look forward to trying this place again!",

Good service.\n\nI ordered a fried tofu appetizer and the sauce was delicious. Miso was also pretty good. \n\nMy bulgogi bento was ok. Meat could have been either flavored more or cooked less. I liked the onions mixed in. The roll with it was just ok...too much rice, though. The salad was terrible. Dressing was mayo-based. Not like a normal Japanes/fusion ginger dressing. Bad. \n\nWife enjoyed all three of her rolls a lot. I tried them all and thought they had too much rice or no texture. And the fish was ok, not great.\n\nIt may be one of the better Asian restaurants around campus, but there are several better ones around town and I will likely stick with those.",

Fastest service I have ever had at a restaurant that wasn't fast food. \n\nWe ordered the bulgogi (spicy of course), Ramen (which we requested to also be spicy), Gyoza, California roll, and my favorite the Dragon Roll. Eel is my absolute favorite sushi. The ramen was different than what I am used to in Japan. There was corn in it which gave it a distinct flavor. \nMy husband said Yummytime has better bulgogi per meat and juiciness ratio.\nBut for sushi. Hands down the absolute best I have had so far since moving here. I will come back when I am craving sushi.  I shared with my 6 year old son and we wanted more! \n\nWe are truly lucky to live next to Purdue, where different cultures collide, and we can have a little taste from our home we had in Japan.",

Sushi was average, it tasted like something you would buy at a grocery store but definitely did the job for the price. The vegetable udon however was pretty bland and the vegetables were over cooked. The portion size was great, but flavor and texture were lacking. Might try the sushi again (since it is a Sushi place), but likely won't get too experimental with the other menu options.",

All delicious!\n\nThe sushi rolls weren't too big, but four rolls was just enough for us two. \n They were all really good but the chauncey roll was our favorite!\n\nThe prices are pretty reasonable and I would say this is a sold 4 restaurant!

You can choose from basic rolls which are around $4-6, and speciality rolls ranging from $6 to $12. There is a large menu of appetizer and non-sushi entree items as well. Both the shrimp dumplings and teriyaki tofu were 100% amazing! \n\nThe staff are welcoming, friendly, and incredibly fast. Plus you get a cup of miso soup included with your meal if you dine in! If you like high quality sushi for a good price, look no further. BONUS: there's a frozen yogurt shop right next door",

      "text": "All around average, though some aspects border on the bad side. Having tried several of the Lafayette area's sushi offerings thus far, this is the worst I've tasted yet. Pieces are smaller than what you would get at other venues, and the ingredients variously do not taste as fresh or otherwise more bland, by one reason or another. Granted, those better sushi places charge $2-$10 more for most of their equivalent or comparable \"specialty\" rolls, so I guess the price in this case reflects the quality. You would be spending, for example, $16-$22 on two large or specialty rolls at Katana or Sushi Don, whereas here, you could get two of said-rolls for about $10-$20. That might be a deal for some, but I personally would rather pay the slightly higher price for good sushi, rather than go to a restaurant to eat gas station sushi. \n\nTheir other food isn't that good, either. I tried the yaki udon my last visit, for instance, and it was all around bland, like the sushi, without much flavour to it other than no-frills soy sauce and too-much-stir-fry-oil. For $2 more, you could get almost twice as many noodles and in a delicious, mildly-spicy sauce from Katana up on Sagamore. \n\nThey give you a \"free\" appetizer of miso soup and vegetables, similar to Sushi Don. But whereas Sushi Don will give you a delicious salad, Maru's vegetables were a few pieces of raw, cold broccoli with a vaguely-vinegar-like flavour, and raw shaved carrots, turnips, or something like that with an unpleasantly acrid taste. I was at a loss to explain why they would serve something so unpalatable, until I saw another reviewer claim that these things are \"pickled,\" which they certainly are not -- just raw vegetables briefly splashed in a vinegar solution. \n\nThe miso soup was also inferior to Sushi Don's, in my opinion -- it could be a matter of taste, but I prefer my miso to not taste and smell like a pungent/stinky variety of tofu. I do not know if it is a regular occurrence, or where exactly the smell was coming from, but the entire restaurant smelled very strongly of sulphur my last visit there, like rotten eggs or sewage. The only other time I ever smelled something similar was in the Jimmy John's nearby some time ago, and given that they don't use eggs over in that venue, I am inclined to think it has to do with West Lafayette's notoriously overloaded sewer system given you \"backdrafts\" now and then in some of the Chauncey village establishments. Wherever the smell was coming from, it ensured that I could not manage to choke down the miso.\n\nService is not great, either. I had a family seated by me my last visit, for instance, but then they were told to move -- no ands, ifs, or buts about, and no apologies given -- for what seemed to be the servers forgetting that they had a large party coming in who would need the space. I was rushed out the door for the same reason, being in the way by their fault. All the while, a bus boy would sneak over to your table and spirit away your dishes, often forgetting to ask whether or not you were done with them. \n\nOne more thing: they either regularly or selectively tack on a gratuity to your bill. My last visit was the first time I was paying the bill while here, and I noticed that, between the two items (the yaki udon and the Sunday Morning roll) plus tax, the final price was about $17. I give them my card, and they come back with a receipt citing $18.35, adding on at least a dollar. Yeah, I don't play that game -- if I am grateful for your food (as gratuity implies), I will give you something extra. You don't automatically help yourself to gratuities. For that reason, more than the mediocre food, I would not come back here.",

I have come here for lunch on one occasion, and for dinner about three times now. \n\nThe service here is quick and efficient. Within minutes of ordering, they bring out the miso soup. It's not the most fantastic miso I've ever had, but hey, it's free. I also typically order edamame, and it's great and tastes very fresh. \n\nI usually order some combination of two rolls as far as sushi goes as my meal. This is where I was very pleasantly surprised - it is incredibly good. I really like the Playboy roll in particular. The fish tastes fresh, the rice is perfect, and the other components just make sense. They have a great selection of rolls, and chances are if you're even just relatively open to the idea of sushi, you will find something you like here. It all tastes fresh and professional, and I really enjoy eating here.\n\nThe only downfall is the price - I know that sushi isn't exactly fast food, but you can easily rack up a $30 bill if you're not careful here. I usually stick to dinner here for that reason, and only every once in a while. If it were a little easier on the wallet, I'd probably be here every week. \n\nOverall though, if you like sushi and you are in the Purdue area, Maru is a must-try.",

      "text": "Visiting the area for my cousins graduation from Purdue and came here for dinner. It was around 8:45 and it was really busy, but we had reservations so were seated right away.\n\nService here was friendly, but the food did take awhile to come out. The soup, salads, and sushi/sashimi came out first. The fish here was very fresh and pretty good. Two of us got their dinner combo sets. This came out last, about 30 mins after ordering. However, portion size was very large, and most of it was pretty good. The combos do come with a stir fry of vegetables though which was basically a waste of space in the bento box. The tempura was slightly soggy. It also mentions a \"fruit salad\", which was just a slice of cantaloupe. Overall, an ok Japanese restaurant for the price.",

If you haven't tried mackerel I recommend it. Their tempura is lovely. The vegetables were delicious. I lived in Japan for five years, lived (and learned to cook) with a Japanese family, worked as a Japanese-English translator. I know Japanese food, and the food at Heisei is excellent. I like the new setting (they moved a year or two ago); it's very spacious and relaxing. We were there tonight with little kids, and it's very family friendly.",

For the price, one would expect some richer broth, better cuts of meat, and higher quality noodles involved. Unfortunately, that wasn't the case. \n\nThe tonkotsu, normally a rich pork bone broth created after a marathon of simmering, was flat and salty. It didn't have the usual signs of fresh-made creation: oils and fat bubbles or robust flavor. Instead, it just had a creamy color and had some spices lazily added.",

      "text": "I loved Heisei in its previous, decades-long incarnation in the Payless shopping center. Once it fled West Lafayette, we were left with a void that was shortly filled by Katana. Heisei has been back for a while now and I finally went after having become a regular at Katana.\n\nThe restaurant space is modern, bright, chic. All solid surfaces, so it's a little loud in there. The sushi counter is pretty nice. Wooden table around an interesting sushi setup. I liked the look of the place.\n\nStaff were ok. A little slow but not that bad. \n\nI ordered the sushi & sashimi combo lunch. It was served with both salad and miso. Lucky me! The salad was very poor. They either don't dry the lettuce or use a very watery dressing. It's the classic \"pool\" at the bottom of the salad bowl. Not good. The miso was nice and tasty. I applaud that effort.\n\nThe lunch came with four sashimi, four nigiri and a small roll half cucumber, half chopped fish of some sort.\n\nSashimi was so-so. I liked the octopus and clam but the actual fish was not as fresh as I expect from a good sushi place. Nigiri was the same story. Just blah.\n\nSushi roll came with Nori on the outside. Who's still doing that? The roll was the quality I would expect from crappy college campus sushi places.\n\nOn the whole, this fish was just not *nearly* as high quality as Katana and it was not as fresh. One piece was actually semi-frozen still. Attention to detail. \n\nI would suggest Katana over Heisei for sure. Prices are about the same.",

I am told that its history dates back to a decision wise Subaru executives made back in the day to hire in a sushi chef to provide landlocked Hoosiers with quality sushi. Today the skills of the staff are indeed apparent in every bite. The menu is expansive, with noodles, rice balls, bento boxes, entrees, and more in addition to sushi selections. \n\nThe house sake is good quality at a great price. We have eaten here several times and tried various sushi orders, rice balls, bento boxes, and udon, in addition to appetizers including various seafood and seaweed salad and a beef tongue special. Everything has been consistently excellent. \n\nThe aesthetic is spare and a bit sterile, in keeping with what you might find in Japan. We have had efficient and courteous service in our experiences at Heisei. The kitchen does tend to get behind on busy nights; the servers have been apologetic about that, and we have found the food well worth the wait.",

      "text": "This review is for the food and the service provided during this Covid-19 issue. \n\nWe ordered from Hunter's using their online order form that we found on their FB page. The ordering process was very simple and a full menu, as well as beer, is available.  The order form gives you the opportunity to customize your sandwiches.  For example \"sauce on the side\" is an option.  \n\nWe ordered the pub chicken sandwich with chips and the High 5 grilled cheese with waffle fries.   My wife got her sauce on the side and I was able to remove the provolone cheese and add bacon. We ordered and the website told us our order would be ready in 15 minutes and gave the instructions on how to pick up.  We arrived at the 15 minute mark, called to let them know we were there, and they brought our order right out. \n\nWe drove to a local park to eat and our food was still hot and good as always!\n\nHunter's has done a good job of adjusting for the current situation.",

I missed their darling nachos grande so we decided to order some for take out and Hunter's did several things right. They not only had the food warm and ready for us to pick up, they packed moist towelettes, napkins, plasticware, and did not skimp out on the food. The amount was as much as we would have if eating in. They seemed really appreciative of our support for their local business.",

      "text": "Decided to try this place out with my BF for some good take out after cooking at home for awhile and to support local businesses. This was our first time and we were looking forward to trying it out. The lady who took our order was very nice and the food was ready in less than 15 minutes. Then we checked our order and found out our half-pound, $11 boneless chicken appetizer only had 10 small chicken pieces. Maybe they were half a pound but I don't think so. We asked the lady and she said that it's always 10 wings to a order so I don't understand why they can't just write that on the menu instead of \"half-pound\" of chicken as it's misleading. The burger and fries were pretty good so I didn't want to review them low due to how good service was and the food was not bad. Just very disappointed by the chicken as it was an appetizer that didn't come with any additional sides besides celery.",

      "text": "Ordered tenderloin- prime rib sandwich and a prime rib steak dinner . I called them back as soon as I got home and realized this is NOT a prime rib . It's more like an old rib eye . The Cesar salad was less then good due to the amount of water in it . The tenderloin was over cooked  and waffle fries . The prime rib sandwich was ok .. and had to feed 2 of us to make up for the bad steak . \nI called the place back to explain the problems and even sent a text to show him the pic and was only offered 2 -$5 gift cards for the next visit . ( even though the dinner was $19.99)  the baked potato was also old and brown . Very disappointed in the results and spending $45 on poor food .",

      "text": "I've now been here three times, and I feel like I can give them a solid 4 stars.  We discovered that if you sit on the left side of the self-seat restaurant, it's the \"drinking\" area, so the waitstaff doesn't see you.  We ended up leaving in a hungry huff, but later realized it was kind of on us.  That said, the restaurant probably should've noticed that two people were sitting there with no drinks and looking around....or put up a sign that says \"Bar service this way, restaurant service that way.\"  I took off half a star for this mix up.\n\nThe second and third times were solid.  I got the same dish both times, and was pleased with the portion size; I walked out super full.  The onion rings are large and battered, which I appreciate more that the crumb coating.  The chicken parm sandwich was yummy.  Spouse had a hamburger the first time, and a frisco melt the second time. In his words, 'They're okay, dawg.\"  Which, translated, means, \"They were okay, but not so good that I won't try something else next time.\"\n\nThe other half star was taken off because of the way they label their bathrooms.  The men's room is labeled \"Hunter,\" and the women's room is labeled \"Hunted.\"  We live in a post-#MeToo era, and this seems pretty tone-deaf.  I don't really want a bar reminding me that it's a place where I could be \"hunted\" by their other clientele.",

      "text": "Hunters is a mixed bag for me, but I think four stairs is fair based on overall food quality, value, beer/food selection, and furnishings. I've been here six or eight times over the years and decided to finally write a review. \n\nI had the black-n-blue burger, well done, with fries. The burger was cooked through without being burnt. The blue cheese was sharp and added good taste and texture. Lettuce and tomato garnish was super fresh. The bun was nothing spectacular, it did not hold up to the weight of the burger or my cutting the sandwich, but did its job and held the burger and toppings together. The fries were a disappointment. These were overcooked and lukewarm. Definitely had been sitting in the fry pile for a while and dried out. There is no excuse for a pub not serving fresh piping hot fries. A disappointment that should drop this review to three stars, but the quality of the second meal buoyed my score.\n\nMy partner had the chicken quesadilla dinner plate, which came with refried beans, rice, some lettuce and sour cream, and a side of salsa too spicy to eat. Very good dish and we had enough quesadilla left for a take home snack. The entire place seemed to be staffed with one bartender and two servers. They kept up with the full house remarkably well. Overall a good value for the price, both meals under $10. My partner got the usual overpriced soda but the server kept it full.\n\nThis pub draws mostly graduate students and the 40-65 year old crowd, local professionals and married folk on a dates or girls night out. There are exceptions, both younger and older, but it's definitely not a college bar. Hunters is a decent pub that benefits from its location, large menu, and lack of competition in this busy commuter corridor loaded with strip-mall and small businesses. The interior is nothing special: a lot of wood, TVs, and chalkboard signage. It's quite boring actually but the pre-geriatric crowd doesn't seem fazed in the slightest.\n\nI'm not a fan, as four stars suggests, but Hunters is a safe bet. Hard to go wrong with this local establishment. Final verdict: 3.5 stars and I'm rounding up due to value. Give me hot fresh fries, and it's four stars fo realz, yo!",

My fiancé and I love to come here for special occasion date nights and we always tell people that it is one of our favorite restaurants ever. We talked about it so much that our families joined us for a meal for a celebration we were having. They all enjoyed the food as well! My family is from out of town, and they were raving about their meal and how they couldn't wait to go back. They still talk about how good the food was! We always joke that we would make the 3 hour drive just for La Scala's food! It's that good!! I seriously cannot recommend this restaurant enough. I've only ever dined inside, and the atmosphere is really nice. It's quiet, intimate, and cozy. I would love to dine outside as well though! They have a really pretty patio area with lights. I can't wait to go back soon! I would also like to add that I am gluten free and they have great options for me, including gluten free dinner rolls!",

      "text": "Thank goodness for La Scala! As a born-and-raised Chicago girl, I require a higher than normal amount of cheese and carbs for daily survival (preferably in the form of pizza, but pasta will also suffice). I admit that I was a bit worried about finding good Italian food after moving to Indiana...but not anymore!\n\nWhen you walk in the door of La Scala, the first thing that hits you is the ambiance. Like Pavlov's dogs, I've been conditioned to salivate when I hear the crooning voice of Sinatra, especially when combined with the smell of garlic in the air. Add in the warm and cozy atmosphere, friendly staff, and ample seating (indoor and out, weather permitting), and I was in heaven. I loooove their menu; I seriously have a list of about 10 items still to try, and had a lot of difficulty choosing which one to start with. Everything sounds SO good! On my first trip I had the pumpkin mac & cheese, with their apple cider cocktail drink. So much comfort food. It's like a hug on a plate! \n\nIf you are looking for a great place to get that homecooked meal even if you're far from home, give La Scala a try. They're open for lunch and for dinner (they do close in between though, so be wary if you're looking for something between 2-5). They cater to special food restrictions, including gluten-free, so get on in there and eat!",

My daughter had the gnocchi bolognese and loved it. \n\nGreat restaurant right on the Lafayette square. Definitely make a reservation on a weekend as they were busy!  Always a good sign!",

      "text": "Can I just say how much I love that they have gluten-free options at the restaurant? Good, because I'm gonna. Italian food was my FAVORITE food before getting a gluten allergy. Now there are far and few dishes that I can enjoy at an Italian restaurant. Not anymore! La Scala is now my go-to place in Lafayette for gluten free pasta!\n\nFirst of all, I love this building! Gothic archway and stained glass on the front entryway. Lovely outdoor seating area with the rustic charm of Italy itself. Did I also mention that they are farm to table and chef-owned? Yep, everything you could ever want to support in a local restaurant is here at La Scala!\n\nI came here with some friends, and everyone LOVED their entrees and drinks. Definitely Try their lasagna. It's fresh, homemade and amazing! You also get your money's worth here. I couldn't finish all of my food, even though I wanted to. The server was very knowledgeable in what items were gluten-free, and if he didn't know he would go and ask the chef. Superb customer service. I can't wait for my next trip to Lafayette so I can sample more of what they have to offer for us gluten intolerant folks.",

      "text": "My best friend has raved about this place for years, but we had never tried it, so when we were picking a place to have a slightly belated Valentine's Day dinner (February 15th), I figured it was time to finally try La Scala.\n\nThe restaurant is small and intimate. I wouldn't really recommend it for groups. There are a few four seater tables, but it looked like most of the tables were for two. However, the tables are very close together (very European style), so if you're looking for a quiet place where you won't hear the conversations of people around you, this may not be the place for you. It wasn't too bad for us, although my chair was touching the chair of the woman behind me. The tables were lovely, set with white tablecloths and tea lights.\n\nThe meal starts with water an bread service. The bread does come with olive oil and spices for dipping (yum!), but the bread has olives in it, so if you're not an olive fan, be aware. You can pick most of them out if you want to though.\n\nWe didn't get any appetizers, though the shrimp and crab dip sounded really good (and then the table next to us ordered it, and it looked delicious, but my husband would never eat it and it was definitely too much for me!). I was torn between the seafood ravioli and the lobster & shrimp mac and cheese; our server recommended the mac and cheese, so that's what I went with. My husband ordered the pollo ripieno without the red pepper cream sauce.\n\nMy husband said his dish was very flavorful, even without the sauce. I absolutely LOVED the mac and cheese. The Grand Marnier cream sauce was lovely, the mozzarella on top was extra melty, and I thought the orange was a thoughtful (and tasty) touch. There was also way more seafood than I expected; there were whole shrimp, large chunks of lobster, and it seemed to be almost as much seafood as pasta!\n\nUnfortunately, we had to cut our evening short (our babysitter called to say our youngest had gotten sick), but our server, Beau, was awesome about getting us the check quickly, boxing up the rest of my meal (I don't think I'd ever had someone else box up my leftovers for me before!), and getting me a cannoli to go (the cannoli was delicious, btw -- very smooth filling!).\n\nGreat food and great service makes La Scala a great choice!",

      "text": "Along with Red Seven and Bistro 501, this has to be one of the most well-to-do places in downtown Lafayette. I suggest getting your special event reservations for this place too a few months early.\n\nVery classic Italian in both aesthetic, ambiance, and food. It's really cute inside, with the art, brick, and dark wood. Though the dining rooms are quite narrow, the high ceilings make up for it and the setting is actually quite intimate. Like Red Seven, the ambiance is quite flexible. You can go there casually with friends, but also on a date or professionally. It does feel a little more mature, classier, or kind of meant for older people, but you definitely get plenty of college students cycling through. On warmer nights, they also have the enclosed outdoor seating with fairy lights, and on warm nights it is its own kind of beautiful.\n\nIf you want something light, get something with the lemon sauce and pair it with their limoncello. However, my favorite is anything with the wine cream sauce. But ingredients are fresh, the pasta is handmade, and they really have something for everyone. Actually, honestly there isn't anything here I don't like. At the end of the meal, I like to have one of their desserts. Tiramisu (which is apparently imported) for dessert if you want to have something absolutely gorgeous at the end. The cannoli is good too, but you can get an equally delicious one at Vienna (coffee shop) for cheaper. They have different kinds of the fresh bread on different days, though I'm not sure of the scheduling a the moment.\n\nThe wait staff are WONDERFUL. In my rush, I once forgot my credit card at La Scala, and they held onto it for me until I got it back. Even better, they verified my identity before doing it, which I appreciate. Also, I had this one incident with some friends and their family where the numbers kept shifting (some people got stuck in traffic) and we sat down to eat and then they came, and then some didn't--the point is that the staff were SUPER accommodating. Not to mention they just rolled with whatever kind of diet the people I brought/with threw at them.\n\nFor a smaller taste, check them out at the downtown food festival Lafayette holds every summer. They almost always have a booth there. Best bet is to park in the garage behind Red Seven. From there, take the doors into the bank offices (I've never actually seen them lock), and walk out through the lobby. It'll place you smack dab on the street corner where you just cross the street and you're pretty much there.",

      "text": "So we walked by this place Saturday and it was quite busy in the courtyard and it smelled heavenly. We were with our freshman who would not have appreciated the deliciousness inside so we went elsewhere. We were going to be here for two more nights. Closed Sunday but went back Monday night. It was again quite busy. The very friendly host found us a table outside and since they were short on staff waited on us himself. \n\nThe bread was a nice treat to start. I had the beef canneloni. I love that they use local ingredients including the beef. The tricolor pasta sheets were a thing to behold. I did not waste a bite of this dish. There is so much that I wanted to try on that menu I'm sure I'll get something different next time but maybe not. Loved sitting outside in the courtyard.",

Locally owned, Bruno's is a beloved and iconic pizza place for those who live nearby as well as those who have driven many miles to return to campus. Everything on the menu is good and the service is excellent, even when the place is completely full. They make the pizzas behind a glass window right next to the front door as you enter. Parking can be an issue, but there is a constant turn over. Be patient for a few minutes and someone will be leaving shortly. You can call ahead to reserve a table and of course, there is carry out as well.",

I've gone here pre-COVID-19, but this review is in regards to their current take-out. The quality and service did not falter by any means. The pizza was ready and hot to take home and everything was nicely packed. There were many people on staff and everything seemed working like a machine, organized and quick. So many moving hands knowing what to do, working diligently and fast. They were very happy to see us and grateful for our loyalty. Their pizza was fresh, super filling, and extra cheese? Yeah, it really means extra cheese and we were very thankful for it!",

Bruno's is a true family business, and the standards have never once changed. While I have never tried any of their pasta dishes, I have no reason to believe they aren't fantastic. The pizzas are always great. Even with COVID-19 limiting the business to carry-out only, I have never had a bad pizza from Bruno's. The inside of the restaurant is a must-see for Purdue fans. Big O's collection of Purdue memorabilia is truly special. I look forward to the day when I can dine-in again!",

It was packed on a Friday night, and I loved the dim lighting and casual feel of the place. The gentleman who served us was very friendly and polite, despite the rush hour.\n\nIn terms of the pizza... I got the Bruno's veggie with jalapeños as extra topping (14 inch, came to approx $20). To be honest, I was quite disappointed. They definitely like their cheese, which I'm a big fan of, but it looked like the cheese had been poured over the toppings, so the toppings were quite soggy under all of that melted goo. The crust and base were not impressive and were a little harder than I'd like. \n\nI might go back to try a non-veg pizza, but if you're a vegetarian looking for a good veggie pizza, I can't recommend Bruno's.",

      "text": "Bruno's is a West Lafayette institution, famous for scissor-cut pizza, Big O's sports memorabilia, and fried dough balls covered in garlic butter and Parmesan. Generations of Boilermaker faithful love this place, and I suspect generations more will too, but not me. I've had enough. \n\nThe pizza ingredients are good, but I prefer mine fully baked, thank you. There's not a square inch of browned cheese in sight at Bruno's. Melted, yes, for the most part. Browned? Ah, no. The restaurant has a very loud sports-themed dining room, covered in sports memorabilia. At full capacity, this room is a claustrophobic cacophony of screaming kids, ESPN, and birthday parties. The Swiss room plays homage to the original Bruno location across State Street, which had a Swiss chalet feel. Chalk that location up to progress and new roads. There's a bar room in the back. \n\nThe best thing on the menu - an antipasto meat and cheese plate - is no more. The final straw was when we were refused a take out cup for WATER. Classic. We got the Heisman on grandma's request for a cup of water for the road. Two pizzas, two sodas, all for $45, mediocre service for free. Sorry Boiler Nation, I won't return to Bruno's. Overrated and overpriced.",

      "text": "This was a favorite restaurant of my husband during his time at Purdue several years ago. After a few visits on our own, and now with kiddos, it is one of my favorites as well! At first glance one could think their menu is what you'd expect to see at a standard pizza joint - but upon closer glance you'll find some really unique menu items: Apple butter & PB dipping sauce for the Bruno Dough on the kids menu, chicken livers on the spaghetti a la caruso, and even a cheese and peanut butter pizza!\n\nMy favorite bits about Bruno's:\n-Memorabilia everywhere - all signed with the owner, Orlando's name! It is clear that he is well-loved. And, my toddler LOVES to explore the restaurant to check it all out. \n-The bruno dough - basically donuts made of pizza dough (8 per order). We get it with the meat sauce, which is also the same meat sauce used in the pasta dishes. It is outstanding.\n-They're kid friendly - meaning they've got a kids menu with decent portions of real food, they serve milk, they provide crayons and paper, and they have slings and booster seats available.\n-The house salad reminds me of the mixed vegetable salads from my time studying in Germany. It comes with radishes, egg, chopped beets, shredded carrots, and more. Yum. :)\n\nMy only beef with Bruno's is that the tap water tastes a little bit off. I don't know any other way to put it, but if you're between a water and a beer, get a beer. ;)",

For you bored types, the classic peanut butter pizza is a must try. I love about three pieces of it then never think of it again til next time here. Bruno's is the classic dinner joint for making memories and has dished out top service since my first pizza here back in their old building. Five stars for sure!",

We had a large pizza with mushroom and pepperoni, Bruno dough, side salads, coffee.  Just amazing tasting meal. This is a neighborhood gem.  Busy place with quality service. Friendly place that has many more menu choices. Brimming with Purdue memorabilia. Television tuned to sports games. Always a festive atmosphere. Bruno's always does it right. Can never wait to return again. Thanks management and staff.",

She said since this is a half order this I the amount we give. I said okay and ended the conversation. Then, from her side she said and I quote her' you get what you pay for, if you want more soup be ready to pay another 4$ for it'. Hearing her say this and bring up money I told her politely it doesn't matter giving a little extra soup if it satisfies the customer. And then she said it matters to us the quantity we give and told me we are happy to not serve customers who are unsatisfied. I said then 'okay thank you, maybe I will not come back ' again in a polite way. I left and she came outside the restaurant while I was going toward my car and said' it will be our honor not to serve you'.\n\nThis is an extremely bad service and impolite behavior. I hope this review gets shared and this person realizes how rude she is! Being kind is the first we learn as a child and teach our kids. I think she needs a lesson on that.",

      "text": "I almost never have Middle Eastern food, but my friends and I were in the mood to try something completely new and expand our horizons. We found this place by chance and decided to give it a chance after seeing other positive reviews. \n\nThe place was much different than I expected on the inside. The decor was really interesting and aesthetically please. It was incredibly clean as well. Our waitress was really nice and friendly. She was also quite fast with taking out order and getting us our food. \n\nI started out with the lentil soup. I had never had anything like it before, but it was very good. I saved most of it to use as a palate cleanser when the spice of my main course started to overwhelm me. I would recommend trying it. It's finely pureed and has an interesting flavor.\n\nMy main course was the chicken biryani. I did really enjoy it, even though the spice was a bit much for me at times (tag in the lentil soup). I wish there had been more chicken. It was seasoned and cooked perfectly. There was a ton of rice that wasn't anything to write home about. \n\nI would definitely say it's worth a try. I enjoy trying something new and out of the ordinary, so this was a great choice for a random dinner.",

If it is possible I will give negative infinite.\n\nFood:2 star. Taste Met my expectation. But could be better.  More Serious problem is, three of us who ordered lamb kebab, had diarrhea problem after dinner. \n\nPrice: 2 star, overpriced and couldn't tell the difference between a half/full size of hummus regarding the serving size.\n\nService: Negative 100.  The lady who served us dinner tonight was extremely rude and unprofessional. The were more than 4 (usually it would be 6 for other restaurant)of us, for sure she could get guaranteed 18% gratuity. Probably that's why we were treated like that. I, politely, asked her how long our food will take for coming, after 30mins wait, she rolled her eyes in my face. Interesting reaction. . Technically speaking, I don't think we did anything wrong or treated her in a unfair standing. We were being polite and patient meanwhile she made us feel we own her 10000 grants.",

      "text": "I cannot get enough of this restaurant. From the outside, it's an unassuming hole-in-the-wall kind of place on the corner of Main and 6th downtown, but hold your judgment and be prepared to be wowed. They've opened during the past year when between-table barriers became standard. So I don't know if they were planning originally to make the section dividers that they've ended up with or if they were a response to Covid, but either way, they're tasteful and artsy. In fact, the entire place has an artistic flair that combines original Japanese culture with a modern Japanese pop approach to style. From the low stools (which are great and much more comfy than they look), to the artwork on the walls, to even the decor and design of the bathrooms, someone has put a lot of thought into the overall vibe and it shows. A fantastic atmosphere.\n\nNow for the best part...the food. My top recommendations are:\n1. I canNOT get enough of they're spicy miso ramen. If you're not a fan of heat, just get the regular miso ramen. It has all of the flavor without the kick. The meat is my favorite part, but the eggs are a close second. I have no idea how they pack this much taste into one bowl. It's unreal.\n2. The gyoza. It's like a chicken-pork pot sticker. VERY delicious and a fantastic appetizer!\n3. The mochi ice cream. It's like ice cream with a soft chewy outside. Hard to describe, easy to eat. I've had the strawberry, and it's worth it.\n\nOverall, a very solid lunch or dinner location. It's informal enough to meet here for a lunch with a friend but would be just as well suited to a Friday night date spot!",

      "text": "I cannot explain to you how good this place is, but I'll try. I just moved here a couple months ago from Virginia and though I'm from the Midwest originally, three years in the south has made me weak to these winters again. Cold Novembers mean solid ramen is a must and Yatagarasu did NOT disappoint.\n\nMy brother and I had the Fried Calamari and Chicken Karaage (not pictured because we got too excited). The seasoning in the breading was impeccable and the sauce for the karaage had such a nice zest to it. The crunch was so solid that it tasted good even to the ears.\n\nWe both got the chicken ramen as our main bowl. My brother asked for \"some tofu\" but our server, Bailey, heard \"sub tofu\" (my brother's mistake, not Bailey's). Bailey was quick to get the original helping of chicken for the ramen and was so sincere about the miscommunication even though it totally wasn't his fault!\nI opted to get a bunch of extras because I'm a man who needs spice, and the chili oil and paste did not disappoint. The broth mixed with the chili was unbelievable. I felt so warm you'd think it was summer. Excellent flavor in the veggies, noodles had the perfect chew, and the chicken was so tender. If it isn't obvious to you yet, this was the best ramen I've ever had. (My brother, though Yelp-less, also agrees.)\n\nWe thought we were done, but the allure of strawberry mochi was too much to resist, so we caved. I didn't expect to enjoy such a cold treat in November but after all of the savory flavors in the ramen, the chilled sweetness was extremely refreshing. 15/10 mochi. Might even have to go back tomorrow for it.\n\nBailey, if you're reading this, you're the man. Also, to all the kitchen staff at Yatagarasu, thank you. Seriously. This meal was a gift.",

      "text": "I've been here about five times now, and I've got to say, it's so nice to have some authentic ramen in Lafayette. I first started to really get into ramen this summer while I was living in Dallas, Texas and ramen places were a dime a dozen. Lafayette, however, doesn't have as many options. Luckily, Yatagarasu is a solid choice. \n\nMy go-to order is the miso ramen. Simple, but delicious. It's savory and hearty while not overbearing. The pork is tender and moist, and I just wish there was more of it. I love the inclusion of a soft boiled egg. It adds to the depth of flavor. \n\nThe other stand-outs here are the small plates. We usually order 2-3 of them as appetizers. The star, for me, are the crispy Brussels sprouts. They're, as the name implies, crispy, with a nice sprinkling of salt and other seasoning. \n\nPrices are pretty decent here. Ramen runs around $13, but it's a generous serving. \n\nService is good, and there have only been a couple occasions where the food seemed to take a while. \n\nOverall, if you're a ramen fan, and you're in the Purdue/Lafayette area, I have no problems recommending this location.",

      "text": "One of the best West Lafayette dining options serving all day breakfast on a huge menu, wonderful value, enticing options with Mediterranean flair and popular American grill eats, friendly staff, and classically modern atmosphere. Us eight hungry guys dropped in a bit late, were reminded we needed to order as they closed at 9:00, still managed a great time with all of our picks finding the pasta almost hilariously piled high, burgers actually two hands, and I went for the hero quesadilla appetizer thinking my two tacos would be the usual tiny amount of food. But happily my two shells were stuffed full of Chipotle sauce ripe for a filling meal. These local family restaurants can easily be overlooked due to popular chains offering predictable menus but I am very thankful to recommend Christos as well and above all the usual national restaurants in the area for value, variety, and an overall excellent time despite an early closing time.",

      "text": "I've been here several times over the years. Christos is never a first choice destination for me, but if someone else suggests it, I'm fine going along. At three stars, \"A-OK\" is a positive and acceptable rating. So go visit for any meal of the day and enjoy, chances are highly likely you'll have good food and catch good vibes from the pies and ambiance. Christos has a \"we're a small restaurant group but we're not really a chain\" independent feel.\n\nI think it's annoyingly loud in this restaurant, depending on where you are seated. I was in a booth near the back last time and it was fine, until others were seated around us. At that point it felt like we were inside of a megaphone. So is it bad acoustics or do I just get seated near loud talkers all the time, or do I have sensory overload disorder? Not sure. The service was good. My gluten-free friend really enjoyed the bunless burger, which was cooked perfectly and seasoned well. I found the fish tacos OK but not stellar. The fries were done but were almost colorless; another 30-60 seconds in the fryer would've crisped them up.",

It's got a great casual but nice atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, and is always clean and efficiently run. It's great at any time of day and they serve breakfast all day. Favorites include the rancher's breakfast, triple double, the turkey club, their fries and their mashed potatoes. Taco salad (\"broken taco\") is also pretty excellent. Give it a chance and Christos can be your Sunday \"I woke up at noon\" brunch spot, your Monday \"I'm too tired to cook\" spot, and more. Last but not least, try the pie.",

I also am a huge fan of oatmeal and tend to be harsh in my judgings of it but the oatmeal here was so good that I got a container for my left over oatmeal. With that in mind I do think that it needs to have different sizes for its oatmeal. This is with added milk, cinnamon and sugar, and cranberries. It had a nice consistency and it didn't feel as though it was over or undercooked. You could also choose to add pecans but I left those out. So I definitely recommend this place if not for their pancakes, for their Oatmeal",

They arrive at around 11PM outside Rawles facing Harry's. The menu consists of every possible type of fried food mixed into glorious sandwiches. Alternatively, they have traditional stand alone options like mozzarella sticks and chicken fries. My personal favorite is the Fat Boy. \n\nIf you go out on campus, Famous Frank's is a must-try tradition. One thing to be aware of - there is a $10 credit card minimum. So either be very hungry or bring cash!",

Think of all the great, fried salty appetizers you want after a night out and then imagine it on a sandwich. It's delicious and everything you need after a couple drinks (or if you're like me, good for any time).\n\nAfter hearing many rave reviews from friends that went to Purdue, I had to make a detour when I visited West Lafayette for a wedding near campus before going back to our hotel and I wasn't disappointed. I spoke with the owner who said him and his sons work the truck. He was really friendly and you could tell right away that he takes a lot of pride in his business.\n\nFor food, I went with the fat rooster (SO GOOD) and got a side of ranch to dip my crinkle cut fries in (yum). Famous Franks is a cool, different kind of place and definitely worth making a stop if you're in the area.",

It's heaven in mouth. Everything I have tried here is delicious.

The mongolian beef was amazing, full of flavor, tender, and juicy. The bulgogi was good but it was too dry for my taste. I'm not a fan of their kimchi tofu soup because I believe that it needs more seasoning. They were good tho.\nHowever, the server did not have the energy we would want to see... He looks really bored and wish that he could be anywhere but there, but maybe it was his off day? I just hope that they will serve their customers with more friendliness.",

      "text": "So Gaza has integrated with Xin and it looks like they might have sushi in the future?? I gave this place a second chance because my boyfriend and I were really craving Korean BBQ. I'm so glad I did! The service was a lot better this time around. \n\nWe went there for an early dinner on a Tuesday afternoon, so it wasn't really busy. The waitress was very attentive and polite. We opted for the unlimited bbq.  We tried the garlic beef, bulgogi, and beef brisket.  All were really good! I especially liked the beef brisket, because it was a really good cut; there wasn't a whole lot of fat on it like at other Korean bbq places. \n\nThe orange sauce that is served with your meal is so tasty and compliments all the meats! I asked the waitress what it was and she wasn't sure BUT said it was made in house! I loved it.  I also really enjoyed the sides that were included: broccoli, fish cake, potato salad, kimchi, and some sort of beans. \n\nAgain, I'm glad I decided to try this place again. I'll definitely be back!",

      "text": "For rural Indiana, this place isn't bad as far as Korean BBQ goes. We came in on a busy Sunday night and got the unlimited KBBQ for $25 a person with an automatic 18% tip (though it's $20 if you go on certain weekdays). There was an air duct so the smell did not disseminate as much, and the meat was soaked in some delicious sweeter bulgogi type sauce. We got the pork belly, bulgogi, and garlic beef, and like the bulgogi the best. However, the service took forever, especially considering the 18% tip, and we were left waiting for minutes on end for simple things like re-lighting our grill or getting extra rice. Given that this is one of the (if not the) only kbbq restaurants in town, it'll do for now.",

      "text": "I really wanted to like this place given the fact that my friends and I love Asian cuisine as well as unique experiences like K-BBQ. Sadly, that wasn't the case here. We wanted to give this place a really fair shot, so we came on a Wednesday at 5:30pm. We figured it would be dead and were correct with only 2 other small groups in the entire restaurant. We all got the basic unlimited which states you have 2 hours at the front but not on the menu (pretty standard time limit). We got the standard start of kimchi, rice, and sauces after our order while we awaited the meat to arrive. We sampled every pork and beef option which is quite a variety of traditional as well as marinated cuts. The food tasted great, and we were having a great time. At the 1 hour mark our server vanished while we waited for him to return to order more. 30 minutes went by (1/4 of our limit) before he finally came back. By the time he came back after our order we were cut off as our time limit was about to expire. We were thinking at 25$ (20 + gratuity) we would be full and content, but we barely had the amount of ordering off the menu. I certainly will not come back ever again as it was a waste of money and felt taken advantage by the \"rules\" and the establishment",

We ordered the pork belly, brisket, baby octopus, blazing chicken, pork butt and garlic beef (SO much food!) you get all the traditional side dishes like kimchi, broccoli, sweet cold mash, rice, etc. Our server was friendly and attentive. My favorite was prob the fact that they give you a DELICIOUS probiotic yogurt once you've finished your meal. It was honestly so refreshing and a nice way to cleanse the pallet.",

Option #1 is 35.00 per person and you get the finer choices of meat. But keep in mind you also have to order off the Option #2 menu which is less finer, I suppose. 25.00 per person. We actually ate off of the Option #2 menu because the meat is delicious and just fine enough. ^_~ Both menus come with banchan and lettuce for wraps. Of course rice and little sauces. \n\nI really had a great experience here. Three stars you question? Well. Three stars isn't bad. It's actually good. But. The bathroom wasn't horrible- definitely could have a better sense of \"clean\". AND... pet peeve alert... They add the tip to your total. I understand why they would see the need.

To make this a 5 star for me, maybe a little bit more attention from the servers since they impose the 18% tip on you. I've been there twice, and both times we had to wait for someone to pass by for a while because the fire went off because the gas tank was empty. The pan needs to be changed more often too. Garlic beef tasted the same as the bulgogi. and maybe more side dishes, they only give you about 5.\n\nThis maybe my 2nd most favorite all you can eat place next to FoGo de Chao despite their inadequacies because of the price. Just set your expectation to the above and you'll be alright.",

As you can see in the receipt we were charged for weekend price on a weekday(7/9/20 Thursday). The price is clearly different on their menu and no where was it posted or mentioned to be different. We said something to Steph our waitress and her response was, \"Right now we're charging all meals at weekend price.\". This would've been nice to know before being lured in for a weekday meal. Couldn't call to confirm because no phone number posted works for this business. Steph confirmed she would refill my water during the meal, yet I ended the meal with an empty glass that was never filled again after being brought to me. Our table asked for the other sides/veggies that traditionally come with the meal and Steph didn't know what we were referring to. She looked over her shoulder at the other diners and asked if we were talking about what they had..yes we were. Then she said they're actually out of that along with multiple other meats we requested with our meal. All this said, food is good when you can get your full meal that you pay for. Don't expect good service or accurate pricing.",

For a while, I used to get the unlimited option, about $25/person... but be careful! It can be a little too much! Nowadays I order my meats individually, about $10 each. I usually get the Garlic Beef, Bulgogi (a little more than $10 but so worth it) and the Beef Brisket. If you get the grill option, you HAVE to try these! Each order for the grill comes with a bowl of rice, this amazing sauce that I would recommend mixing into your rice, and an assortment of sides such as fish cakes, pickles, broccoli, edamame, and a couple more. I don't remember because I always leave room for my meat! I haven't tried their main dishes which I've heard are good, but I suggest grilling if you do. \n\nParking: Big parking lot outside \n\nPrice: I usually end up spending around $20, but you can definitely get away with less. \n\nSpeed/Service: If you're grilling, they'll bring out the meat right away and they're attentive to when you need to change your grill plate. Plenty of seating available!",

She questioned our manners, said that this \"policy\" has been in effect for a month while we had dined multiple times in the last month, always tipping well over 20% each visit. Even if this policy is new, and the menu has not been updated then it is your job as a waitress to let customers know of this \"policy\" before being seated.

We really appreciate that, unlike some other places, they've continued doing contactless curbside pickup, even after they reopened their dining room. Some of the dishes we've had and really enjoyed this summer include the pecan crusted trout, the mushroom cavatappi in marsala cream sauce, the burrata caprese salad and the french onion burger. I like that they change their menu seasonally because most other restaurants around here don't, and even great menus get boring when they've been offering the exact same food for years. It's definitely pricey for the area (entrees, especially ones containing seafood, can be $30+) but the food puts them up there among the best restaurants in greater Lafayette.",

      "text": "I'm kind of torn between 4 and 5 stars but am erring on the side of generosity primarily because I think restaurants should be supported in these Covid-19 times and Bistro 501 deserves special mention for having curbside no-contact pickup, which not all restaurants do. The food is also excellent-- the French Onion burger, which is what I always get when my wife and I visit our daughter and her family and get food from here, may very well be the best hamburger I have eaten in Lafayette. \n\nThere are two reasons, though, that I am a little ambivalent about giving 5 stars. The first is the fairly skimpy menu, at least as far as I am concerned. The primary reason that I always get the French Onion burger is that there really aren't any other entrees that I like all that much. There are nine entree items, only two of which involve red meat (I'm a carnivore); the other items include seafood, vegetarian, and chicken or hen selections. The other meat item, filet mignon, looks good, but I'm not about to pay 44 dollars for a steak.  \n\nAnd that brings me to the second reason: the prices. 18 dollars for a burger? That seems kind of ridiculous, given that this restaurant is in Lafayette, Indiana, not New York City. It is, as I noted above, a first-rate burger, but I don't really believe it's worth 18 bucks. \n\nBottom line: very good food and a nice place to patronize if you're nervous about eating out or having contact with strangers, but meat eaters may find the pickings a bit slim and I'm not sure the quality of the food justifies the prices. A great place to eat, though, if you're looking for a special treat, trying to impress a date or are taking a job candidate out to dinner.",

      "text": "Literally the best food I've had in the Lafayette area! The atmosphere here is excellent and the food and service are really superb. It's pricier but you get what you pay for here. Definitely an elegant place to have drinks, go on a date, or just have a nice night out! You really can't go wrong with any of the drinks or food on the menu.\n\nThis location is busy and parking in the area can be difficult. Get an early start looking for parking if you have a reservation during peak hours. The staff will call and check up with you to see if you're still coming if you are running late. I was--driving in circles looking for a spot, d'oh!--but they held my table without issue.\n\nMy server was super nice and the manager was beyond delightful. She really took the time to connect with the many guests there and made me feel super welcome. I'm so excited about their future endeavors and will definitely be back!\n\nI had a coconut drink (so good!!), bread/butter, a gorgeous salad, a duck confit dish, and creme brûlée. Everything exceeded my expectations and was so wonderful to enjoy. \n\nI can't wait to take some guests to this restaurant in the near future!",

Obviously as a French restaurant they have a great variety of wine choices. Typically three course dinner. We had the shrimp tempura and Tuscan bruschetta as our first course ( exquisite !!!) for our main course we both had the pork chop ( seasonal / on temporary menu that the chef releases frequently ) and it was AMAZING. I definitely am looking forward to visiting again for brunch and during the summer time.",

There is so much to enjoy here from the wonderful staff, tastefully decorated inside and out, and a traditional blend of French cuisine with American flair. I came here for my birthday for the first time with my group of four others and all enjoyed dishes from soup, duck, lobster to beef. The Burger was the surprise, easily the most Fantastic Burger I have ever had in my life. What an amazing blend of ingredients that come together for flavors making many steaks embarrassed. The duck poutine was also a stand out, amazed us all! My lobster and crab cannelloni was rich and even though the cream and ricotta took over most of the dish there was some nice flavors poking through. Good words also for the soups and boeuf bourgignon - pure delicious beef and extremely well done with very soft and tasty morsels. The drinks were also well crafted, the desserts very nice, and we will definitely be back for another celebration.",

      "text": "A chic French bistro with country charm and incredible cuisine -- what's not to love about Bistro 501?\n \nAlthough I'm not a Lafayette local, I travel here frequently for business and this has become my go-to for sit-down meals. Most recently, I stopped in for an early lunch during the busy Christmas shopping season. While I didn't have a reservation, I was quickly seated. The staff was very attentive, taking my order and then bringing out my meal before the dining room filled up for the big lunch rush.\n \nThe menu always features seasonal and sophisticated dishes. This time I started with a cup of sugar pumpkin and wild rice soup, which was perfectly rich and creamy -- just as a French soup should be! For my main course, I ordered the humongous beet and goat cheese salad, which was well appointed with lots of other goodies like wild rice, pepitas and oranges. I added salmon, which turned out to be a full portion. The whole dish was so flavorful it could easily stand on its own, but a few touches of the creamy apple cranberry dressing put it over the top!\n \nThe beautiful details -- lovely old portraits, antiques and carved wood finishings -- throughout the dining room make a spectacular backdrop for the meal.\n \nKeep in mind, this is an upscale French restaurant, so you should expect to pay a little more. But the portions are large and the overall experience is well worth it.",

Our pommes frites also came with this really yummy red curry ketchup, plus two other fun sauces which I thought were unique and added a nice twist. \n\nCute little thing that has nothing to do with food, nor does it really matter in the grand scheme of things but I'm adding it anyway: the bathroom sinks had cool little color-changing lights on them so that you'd know when the water was hot, warm or cold (,: \n\nOverall I really loved this place, and I'd say it's worth the price!",

The whole staff is professional and experienced. We had the Turkish lentil soup which was slightly sweet and hardy, really delicious. The pork chop was so soft and cooked perfectly. The broccolini pasta was amazing, creamy and perfect texture with the walnut crust. Props to the chef and the owner. The place does has strange hours and is always booked so make sure to call to make a reservation even if they aren't open. You can leave a voicemail and they'll call you back.",

Fine Dining in the home of Astronauts, Engineers, a world renowned Collegiate Music Organization (with no music degree available?!?) and a big-a$$ bass drum... who'da thunk it!\n\nOn this early December evening The French inspired Bistro provided a spectacular meal and impeccable service as a Lafayette Christmas parade floated by. \n\nA table next to a warm easy burning fireplace for the evening, at least 2 1/2 hours, made way to signature cocktails, beginnings of meat and cheeses followed by delicious and beautifully presented pasta's, chops, fish and steaks accompanied by a bottle of red and a bottle of white (nod to B. Joel) from the Bistro's superb cellar.\n\nThe evening was finally closed with shared desserts, in Funkster fashion, and an aromatic and rich cup of French roast, naturally from... a French press.\n\nIt truly was L'Amour from first bite, just remember to have plenty of Francs on hand - even though dead presidents is easier.\n\nWill we return? Well as my good friend PePe Le Pew has said, \"One nice thing eez, the game of love eez never called on account of darkness!\"",

      "text": "My previous review from 2015 was a 3, and the reason for it was that it was an \"institution\" and so while the food was just okay you kind of knew were you stood with it. \n\nWell. Bistro kind of took us for a terrible ride when we were planning our rehearsal dinner spot for our wedding. My mom hosted the rehearsal, so we planned her visit to Lafayette so she could try the two choices (Bistro and East End). My now husband's parents came along as well as a treat. We tried basically everything in the menu that was vegetarian**. The food was okay, but not mind blowing. Still, it's the type of atmosphere that my parents prefer, so they were leaning toward hosting the dinner at Bistro for about 30 people. However, despite having talked to my mom before, and knowing that she was the one paying, the manager just kept on addressing only my husband's parents. Was it because they're American and my mom has a thick accent? (despite being fully fluent?) I don't know, that was kind of our assumption. At some point my mom said \"excuse me, I'm the one that's hosting\" and the manager said something really awkward like \"yes, of course I know\" just to go back to ignoring her. Anyway, maybe this all seems like a bunch of petty stuff, but mediocre food (see previous review), poor manners, and feeding me fat duck (see note below). Just no.\n\n** pretty sure, as I found out later, their fries are fried in duck fat, and we talked several times about how we were vegetarians at that time, so wtf. Extra wtf.",

      "text": "This cozy neighborhood bar and restaurant has been around for generations. The original Parkside was a humble shack serving inexpensive food and drinks to Columbian Park  visitors and neighborhood. This latest iteration features more upscale food and local brews.\n\nPrices are a bit higher than I believe the surrounding neighborhood can regularly afford, but with the new stadium being completed this spring and hopefully Covid getting under control, The Parkside should be rocking. \n\nThe Parkside features scratch made appetizers and entrees. I had the pastrami sandwich with onion rings. The pastrami (and corned beed) are made in-house and smoked. The pastrami was thinly sliced and placed on toasted rye bread with mustard and swiss cheese. I felt the pastrami was over smoked, the smokey flavor overpowering the flavor of the meat. This may just be a one-off, but with the scarcity of pastrami in Lafayette, I'll take it.\n\nThe onion rings were, how can I  put it, were perfect! The breading appeared to be a cornmeal mixture, giving the rings a solid crunch. The onion itself was tender and flavorful. \n\nI'm definitely giving the pastrami another try.",

      "text": "We chose to do takeout for our first visit. Some of the highlights: The guacamole and the salsa were both very nice. The guac was creamy and tasty, just the way it should be. The tortilla chips were great as well, light and crispy, not too salty. The tacos were okay, but not spectacular. The only real problem was that we didn't order any of the above. Somehow the orders got mixed up and we were given somebody else's order. It wasn't a huge problem, as the sizes of the respective orders were about the same, but we didn't discover the switch until we'd left. I would have loved to try the beef cheek tacos, which I hadn't seen anywhere else. Perhaps we'll make it back sometime for another try.",

I walked back to the register because I didn't see anyone and then went back to the open kitchen window. There was a woman cooking meat, with no gloves on who pulled up her mask, grabbed a piece of the meat with her bare hands and took a bite. Another worker saw me witness this and glanced at my phone as if to see if I caught it on camera.\n\nShe told me where to go after I awkwardly asked for a menu and I went straight to my car instead of the restaurant.\n\nThe meat that was being prepared was steak, in bulk, so I'm sure it would be used for plenty of meals. I was disgusted at what I saw, ESPECIALLY during a pandemic.\n\nI was excited to try them out for the first time, now I feel like I dodged a bullet.",

Last time it was much thicker. I like this version way better.\n\nThey were out of pastor, but I had asada, chorizo and beef tongue. All three came with a huge mountain of meat, two tortillas, tons of cilantro and onions. Green and Red sauces with the tacos were both very good. Nice smokiness to the red, and the green was the right balance of flavor and heat.\n\nFantastic meal. Won't take me three years to get back again after that meal.",

It says that they are open starting from 9AM on weekdays online and on the storefront. However, I was going for lunch at 11 and the restaurant was not open yet. I go into the store and they said they are waiting for the waitress.... \n\nYou get free chips and salsa. The ambience is cute with a lot of decorations going on. However, there are several TVs and the music is pretty loud. We were the only ones dining in for lunch, but a few people came in for to go orders. Since we were the only ones dining in, our waitress kept disappearing and it was hard to find somebody when we needed service. \n\nThe food was pretty good, I got the gordita. It was cheesy and the steak meat was delicious. Just not worth going out of the way when the hours might not be consistent and hard to get a hold of the wait staff while we're sitting there.",

      "text": "I was very skeptical of this place because of the location...it's right next to a mini mart in the middle of nowhere. But, some really great, authentic places are in really sketch places so I stayed optimistic. Then, no one was there to greet us when we came in. We awkwardly stood there for a bit, but I just ended up grabbing menus and sitting wherever. About a minute later, the waitress found us and asked us what we wanted. When we weren't ready to order food, she rolled her eyes at us and went to sit at the front desk. Not sure why she had an attitude with us, the place was pretty dead (2 other tables there). Anyway, we ordered and got our food pretty quickly. I got red enchiladas with beef and my BF got the carne asada. \n\nWarning - the red enchiladas are SUPER spicy. When my chicanx friends make them, they taste pretty mild - but these were 4/5 spiciness level. I looked at the menu afterwards and there is no warning or indication that they were spicy. No red vs. green being more mild or spicy. In addition, no warning from the waitress that the salsa would set my mouth on fire. Anyway... luckily I could handle it and still enjoy my meal without sending it back. I even had leftovers the next day and it wasn't half as spicy as it was the day before... Maybe one side was doused in chile and the other wasn't. \n\nAnyway, my BF enjoyed the carne asada a lot. Overall, food is delicious and authentic. My major complaint is the service and the lack of spiciness warning for the enchiladas. Despite the low review, I still would come back because authentic Mexican food is hard to find here. Only place I've seen that offers lengua, tortas, and menudo.",

The beans are some of the creamiest I've had in a long time. I'm pretty confident the tortillas were hand made judging by how tender they were, and also how they were not uniform (in a good way!).\n\nTheir menu included a nice selection of frozen fruit smoothies as well, and there is a cooler of fruit and ice cream popsicles by the cash register.",

The margaritas will floor you - if by only sheer size. I think the one I had was 27 oz or something and WOW!!!

They seem to be waaaay understaffed or they need more training. After being seated the chips and drinks arrived quickly. Then the wheels fell off. It took nearly 10 minutes for the server to appear to take our order. The food arrived in a timely manner but that was the last time we saw our waiter. After we were done and the plates cleared off the table, we waited for our check. And waited, and waited. Finally, with people waiting to be seated and seeing us just sitting there the hostess came over to see if we needed anything. I explained we had been waiting over 10 minutes for our check. She got our check and we paid and I doubt we will be back. The food was good but not any better than other Mexican restaurants we've been to in Lafayette.",

Tasted ok, not outstanding.\n\nChips were ok, salsa was good.\n\nI had a quesadilla which tasted like processed cheese. Lot of steak, though and it was cooked right. Also had an al pastor taco and a fish taco. very bland. Borderline flavorless.\n\nKids ordered kids meals of burrito & taco. Ordered the burritos both to be a bean burrito with just beans, no cheese, no nothing. The guy brought bean burritos covered in red sauce and cheese. Then when I pointed out the problem he accused me of incorrectly ordering it. Sorry, I ordered a burrito to have just beans and expected it to have just beans. I even said no cheese...if I didn't want cheese IN it it should be safe to assume I didn't want cheese ON it, but by all means ask if you're not sure! \n\nThe food was sub-par, and I don't appreciate being blamed for a screwed up order. Also the menu is 200 items. Yes, you read that right. TWO HUNDRED. No restaurant in the world could possibly cook that many items well and maybe that's why the food here is bad. Also they have American food on their menu and not just a few items. I don't get it, but it doesn't matter because I won't be back.",

This was our first visit so we went traditional... something we could compare to...  shrimp/chicken/steak fajitas and chicken enchiladas + a tamale. Everything was clearly made to order except the refried beans and rice. The steak was tender and not over cooked. Really great skirt steak. Service was very friendly, patient, and informative about the menu. Only recommendation I'd have would be to expand the side offerings a bit to match the excellent entree menu. The sauce on the tamale was a little heavy, and unnecessary given how GREAT the tamale itself was. We will be coming back to this place frequently.",

The food here isn't quite up to the standard of my favorite Mexican place in Lafayette (Mi Cabanita) and the prices are higher, but it's a big step up from the other Mexican options (mostly national chains) in this part of town. On our first visit, the portions were really massive, but they seemed to be a bit smaller the second time we visited. I hope that's just a coincidence and not a trend.

Definitely recommend this. My friend got their nutella crepe which was a little too sweet. Probably best sharing this with someone. \n\nMimosa's were yummy and overall, a great experience.

The $15 cheese tray came with decisions (French, Italian, sweet or savory sides) so I asked Michelle's opinion.  We settled on olive tapenade and onion chutney.  It came with three cheeses, melba toast, apples, raw almonds and grapes.  It was a very generous portion and beautifully presented.\nThe melba was perfect and I would LOVE the chef's recipe.\n\nIf only the Cellar Wine Bistro wasn't 90 miles from home, I would be a loyal and frequent guest.",

My Gyro panini was perfect! So tasty, rich and fresh combo of traditional ingredients, zesty and savory for all the right taste buds. Pizza went down well too though could do with a thick crust option for the thick appetites. It's a decent value and easy pick for the easy family or friends dinner fix, plenty of parking on streets, great location, and hopefully things get back to normal soon so the 8pm closing is extended.",

Ton of melted cheese with a side of a Southwest sauce.  The dough on this sandwich was again amazing. My hubby got the Niko panini (sorry pic is bad). Ham, bacon, lettuce and tomato with a side of honey lime sauce.  I liked the sauce but he didn't. Before we  even left my  husband was already naming things he wants to try on the menu next time.

They have a great patio to sit outside and enjoy good weather, and the inside is a pleasant little dive pizza joint. I would recommend this as a family night out, date night, and a good place to bring a large group of friends/teammates. They are open late during the week, so it's a great place for college students. We got a Greek salad, which was tasty for an iceberg lettuce based salad and was pleasantly seasoned with oregano. We also got an Al Pastor pizza, which was fantastic. The pork was tangy and juicy, and the garlic sauce perfectly complimented the pork and pineapple. Unfortunately, the dough was undercooked and nearly soggy.",

I do wish they offered more than one size for thin crust though, bummer, but we made the medium size work by offsetting our ferocious appetites with an appetizer. We got the garlic breadsticks. Normally I wouldn't weight an appetizer so heavily on a review, but after careful deliberation, I feel it is the right call. \n\nThe garlic breadsticks were greasy. Wayyy too greasy. They came with marinara and cheese sauce. Both of those were, really not very good. Coupled with the fact that the breadsticks were $7, I was displeased. \n\nAgain, the thin crust pizza -- good! The appetizers, maybe skip them.",

Inside is small but It handles the lunch rush. Outside seating is available. The menu is deep. Subs, wraps, panini, calzone, pizza, salads, breadsticks, select Mexican, and more I'm probably forgetting. The wraps are stuffed with fresh ingredients with the dressing in the side. Although I've only ever seen two people working a lunch hour, the food comes out fast. It's tucked away in a residential area just north of downtown on a one way street so it may be hard to find and get to but it's totally worth It especially for lunch. It's my new favorite place. UPDATE 3/6/18 The meaty calzone I ordered today was cold in the middle. I'll return but can't recommend the calzones.",

      "text": "The Pickle, formerly known as Niko's Spicy Pickle, is really good. I don't know what happened to Niko. Best wishes, my friend. The new owners and staff are delivering a great product. They have an unusually light and airy pizza and breadstick dough. It's really tasty, brushed with butter and some Parmesan cheese. The different dough differentiates The Pickle in an otherwise crowded pizza market. It's thin crust pizza, but not very crispy. Again, the airy dough makes it special. You don't feel like a mouthful of bread, but yet you get that tingly carb-o-licious feeling.\n\nWe visited on a Monday evening. Specials listed on the left as you enter. Order at the front. Find a seat and the food is delivered fast! We were the only folks there at the time, so our order went directly in the oven. Fast and friendly service by the only guy working there. The only down side I can find, Pickle does not offer Parmesan cheese at the table. At least not what I could see. Crushed red pepper shakers available by the drink machine.\n\nI will return for pizza and breadsticks, and maybe try a sandwich or calzone. It all looks good! Our antipasto salad was fresh, could have used more meat but overall it was good. Some desserts and side items available too. I was impressed with the cleanliness of the place, the local feel, the great service, and most of all, the airy and tasty dough. Nice job, Pickle!",

      "text": "There's a lot of little brewery's in Lafayette/West, so I was pretty happy to find out that LBC stacks up against them all and even brings the best in some cases. The main appeal is that they are a brewery and full kitchen unlike Peoples and Brokerage which is nice because you can totally come for a nice date or have a couple with the boys. The food is much better than the reviews that I read prior to coming. Everything is from scratch and they certainly have a few standouts which include the shrimp po boy, fish and chips, and chicken tippy. The beer selection is a little low for a brewery with about 10-12 taps, but the lack of variety is made up for in value (4.89/20oz pour makes it the cheapest craft beer in Lafayette area) as well as quality of the beer which is phenomenal. The service is always great and they are good with covid measures. If you're a student or someone in the area, LBC should definitely become a go-to.",

      "text": "Over the bridge and down the street from the chaos of boilermaker stadium is an establishment called Lafayette Brewing Company. My first thought was to get out of town to escape the football madness. Unfortunately, so did everyone else!\n\nUpon arriving we were stopped in the doorway as it was standing room only. The chaos was insane and the staff were totally taxed - management should be proud of the staff working tonight as they were all busting their hump for this unruly crowd of soaked patrons. On the other hand, management should also be apologizing to their staff and patrons for being GROSSLY unprepared for the work these few staff burdened.\n\nWe arrived at 6:30 and were told we'd be seated in 10 to 15 minutes. Chaos, utter chaos! We had people arriving after us that were someones friend and they were seated then the cry me a river story of \"I had to sit all day in the rain and now I have to wait to pay you. I'm taking my business elsewhere.\" Oddly, they too were seated. We continued to patiently wait. Fourth five minutes into waiting and watching patrons come and go, I asked \"when are we going to be seated?\" And was told, I was just going to page you, your table is ready. We sat at a table to the left of the door that was available and unoccupied for the past forty minutes. Yes, I was annoyed.\n\nWe took our seats and promptly asked to taste two beers. Our server Cody, was a stud! Running all over the place helping everyone and really stretching himself. The problem was we got our samples about 20 minutes after we ordered them.\n\nCody took our orders and we ordered chicken nachos, chicken tilly, rib tips and pork belly. I finished the pork belly and my beer was served. Wow - crazy slow. At this point, the restaurant was slowing down and people weren't standing at the front door. Our food was just served and nearly after an hour into seating I had my first beer. Yep, you guessed I was annoyed. On the other hand, my spouses beer hadn't been served until about an hour and ten minutes after ordering. Excuses aside that's ridiculous considering we ordered promptly when seating. \n\nNow that's one aspect of the experience.... at a brewing company. Maybe they were making it?\n\nOur dinners were served cold and not exciting. The rib tips were not tips and they were burnt to jerky! The so called sauce that was to accompany was not present and the Parmesan fries lacked Parmesan! The chicken tilly was just wrong. Cornbread is not supposed to be ruined unless it is bad to begin with and this was a great example of that! Now how could anyone ruin nachos? Right. Well I don't know who is in the kitchen but they need to pull their head out. The was the most awful food I have put to my lips in a very long time. \n\nDuring this meal we had waited so long for my wife's beer that she was through with eating and it still wasn't served. We flagged Cody down and told him to cancel the beer order as we were through. Through with waiting and really didn't want to waste anything more. Oddly shortly after canceling the order, her beer is served! What's up with that? \n\nAgain I am very disappointed with what was expected to be an easy meal. Sadly, this is not a restaurant I am going to suggest returning to until management changes how it is run more efficiently. Food needs to be served hot and drinks cold not the other way around. Tables need to be bused clean immediately and patrons sat efficiently. \n\nOne day I will revisit this place and I hope it's better than tonight as it doesn't deserve the star I am giving it. The star is for Cody as he was the best he could be with the resources he had available to him. It really is poor when a team doesn't play together, Nobody wins playing for themselves!",

      "text": "I want to give this place a higher review, but I've been disappointed here several times. Location is great. Perfect place to grab a beer and bite before a show at the Long Center or Lafayette Theatre. The beers are hip and local. Inside seating is boring, needs updated. The patio area is really nice, but I always feel slightly forgotten when sitting outside. \n\nService was much better this time around. In a previous visit the waiter rang the meals up on the wrong cards. It was a mess. The beer cheese soups is beyond nasty. I wanted to love it, but it tasted like vomit. The scotch eggs are sooo good! Definitely a solid appetizer. Tonight I tried the Chicken Tippy. Flavors were good, but the dish was not warm. The chicken needed more sauce and needed to be hot.",

Our server, Darrius, was super polite and helped me pick my main meal because everything sounded delicious.\n\nMy gal and I split the hummus plate which was presented beautifully and had plenty to go around. She's got a smaller appetite so she ordered the house salad and threw in some of the hummus to jazz it up. I got Darrius' recommendation of the Chicken Tippy; the cornbread pancake underneath the chicken was wonderful, chicken very flavorful, and the side of cajun fries had a solid heat and crunch. The only thing keeping this from a 5 star was that I could've used some more sauce drizzled on the chicken to counter the dry nature of the cornbread, but we're certainly going to come back here more and I know I won't be disappointed! \n\nOverall, a pleasant and quaintly atmosphere for a casual Friday night date, great staff, and tasty food!",

      "text": "What a great local brewery located in the heart of downtown with street parking and great huge windows to look out at while dining. \nI came about 2:30 pm on a Saturday and it wasn't busy. I was able to go inside with my tween and we noticed all the great woodwork and art on the wall. Very clean inside with plenty of tables that were large enough to fit 4 or more people and some tables by the window. Greeted by a young lady and seated right away. The waiter came to our table quickly and we ordered waters, I don't like when they come so fast and ask if we know what we'd like to drink and eat. For never being here before I def needed some time over the food menu and extensive beer menu. After all, i came to have a beer. \nAfter deciding on a few small appetizers and a beer I noticed that hey also offered croaker specials on this day and after tasting their light crisp beer they had on tap, sorry forgot the name, I ordered one to go to to enjoy later with some friends.  Appetizers came within a good time frame and we weren't over impressed by them. The chips were meh and the soup didn't really wow me. It came out a little more more hot than like warm and it def could have been more heat hot. \nThe beer however, hit the spot and if I was out with some friends I would have enjoyed a couple more. Decent prices on food and beer and would be a great place to hang out with friends or go on a date. \nI bet this place gets packed with college kids on the weekends. \nThey do have a separate bar room that is a good decent size with tables and bar stools. Plenty of nostalgia based beer signs hang all over but it's right off the dining room and you can hear the noise from the bar seeping into the atmosphere of the dinning room. I wouldn't doubt that when this place gets busy it would be pretty loud inside. Sadly there isn't any outside seating but the windows help.  It is a bit dark inside due to all the wood and dim lighting. \nI cannot say for our experience that staff was super friendly or had personality and the food was mediocre but a great place to try local beer and support local business with I love. Def worth giving it a try and have fun with friends or a date night.",

      "text": "From the outside this establishment looks hip and standard for a brewery restaurant. When you walk inside the look is more dated, less clean and less focus on aesthetics. There is seating outside. We asked to be seated outside and the manager who helped us at the host station said there were no outdoor seats available and laughed and said he had no idea when I asked what the wait for outdoor seating was... ok. I guess it's crazy to think the manager cares. He actually said he doesn't check to see when tables are finishing like that would be crazy talk. \n  So we sat inside and were seated immediately. Sunday is kids free night at the brewery so it was pretty loud inside. The menus are sticky and not clean. And there was not a beer menu on the tables. They were out of 2 including the only wheat beer they had. One at our table wanted a wheat or Hefeweizen and I could hear someone at the table next to us sling as well.   After we place our orders another server came by, greeted us and let us know he was our server. Okay... we let him know we already ordered and he said yeah it's chaotic tonight. So far I was thinking their management is seriously lacking here. \n  On to the food...  \n\n  I tried a flight of beers also\nLacafe- red ale with coffee. Nice mellow beer with coffee hints. This is good if you don't want a stout but would like coffee nuances. \nJacktown amber- more traditional red ale. I'm getting the feeling these beers won't punch you with flavor but they are balanced, drinkable and pleasant.  Got the toffee notes \nBlack angus oatmeal stout - first notes a little sour followed by toasted oatmeal. Not great but not bad. Nothing to set it apart.",

      "text": "This was my first visit to a Lotsa which I really enjoyed.  The facility is very clean, large, socially distanced, open and white!  The subway tile in the wall really brightens the restaurant.\n\nUpon coming in the facility you have to figure out where to go.  It's not obvious.  One you get funneled down the shoot...you get to the kiosk to enter tour order.  The menu is simple.  The order entry process was actually pretty easy.  There was only two staff in the restaurant at the time.  One was focused on making food.  The order caller was very friendly and helpful.\n\nFor dinner we ordered several items.  The Apple Pie wings were outstanding.  The wings were very moist.  They weren't very large and there were only 6 wings for $8. The BBQ sauce was nice...not overpowering but added a nice taste without being dripping wet.\n\nThe Caesar salad pizza was very innovative.  The Caesar salad was fresh.  The dressing was much like you expect.  The amount was just right to give the salad taste without ruining it.  The cheesy bread underneath was outstanding.  The bread was soft and the cheese was delicious!\n\nThe Caprita pizza was also delicious.  The tomato sauce was light with a slightly spicy taste.  It had a mild tomato taste that was much more mild than a normal marinara sauce.  The toppings very light but fresh and tasty.  The balsamic glaze was strong in taste but had a wonderful accept to the cheese, sauce and veggies.\n\nI was disappointed that the fountain soda machine was out of service.  They gave me a bottled Diet Coke from the cooler. I had to ask for a cup and ice because the bottle was warm..and the soda was very flat.\n\nOverall...I really liked Lotsa.  Give it a try!",

      "text": "Pizza on Purdue's campus is absolutely nothing to write home about. Sure, I'm an IU grad so I'm biased but outside of Mad Mushroom, you really don't have options. At all. So when my friend and I visited 2 years after gradating, we were amazed to se an addition to West Lafayette in Lotsa Pizza.\n\nThe name might need help, but the pizza definitely doesn't. While we had our sights set on a food tour, we knew we wanted pizza so we kept it light, splitting one pizza to save room for dessert. I have a policy with new places- KISS. Never experiment, and always veer towards a margherita-esque option to judge fairly. The same rules applied here.\n\nCurrent Boilermakers are pampered with this pizza: with a wood-fired crust that reminds me of MOD in Indianapolis, this pizza is the veritable opposite of the Merriam-Webster definition of 'college pizza.' It's well-crafted, unique, balanced, and NOT over-indulgent.\n\nSure, it won't cut it when you're hungover, but that's what Mad Mush cheesestix are for. This is a pizza you can build into your life in regular intervals and proportions without risking the Freshmen 15.",

      "text": "For my recent birthday, I chose Lotsa Pizza so that my family could select their own pizzas and know that they are safe since Lotsa offers gluten-free crusts. (The four of us all have Celiac Disease.)\n\nBoy was I wrong.\n\nThe wait to order our pizza was long even though there were not that many people in line. The employees seemed overmatched. But that was not the worst part of our experience.\n\nI made it clear to the employee taking our order that all four us were gluten-free due to allergy. For some reason, he only wrote Allergy on three of the sheets that accompany the pies. He made my older son's pizza on regular crust.\n\nFortunately, the guy who puts the pies in the oven discovered the error and they remade the pizza. However, that was not communicated to us and when I went back to ask what was being done, I was completely ignored even though I was two feet away and politely saying, \"Excuse me\" to get his attention. Finally, another employee had the courage to make eye contact and assured me that he was remaking the pizza.\n\nStill because of the time to remake the pizza, other pizzas with gluten crusts were put in the oven. That potential cross-contamination could be the reason that my son felt sick after eating.\n\nLotsa reasons to never return to this place.\n\nEdit: Since I cannot reply directly to the owner's comment, I will do do here. No, sir, I do not want your offer of free pizza. Your employees made two of my family members sick because of negligence. As I said, we will not be back.",

I uploaded two photos to better show. The pile you see at the top is an entire piece + crust included - not just the toppings.

Prices here are great, gluten free crust available, menu has original flavors, and place has plenty of space for large groups but wish there was more informative pricing on adding toppings for a custom pie. I'd like to see other sizes available too since a group having to order their own personal pizzas each gets really hassled and frustrating trying to make each person pick a topping and hope they all eat everything. That's obviously getting very picky. Only real issues are limited and awkward parking especially on busy weekends and watching the nice people try to handle the sardines (c'mon guys it's a great salty addition completely transformed in flavor when it gets on pizza.... OK might still be just for me but I'm all about that option here! few other spots in the whole city offer sardines on pizza).",

No other establishment would've fit better in orange leaf's place (RIP). \n\nEverything was good, but if I had to pick something that limited my pizza love, then it'd be the 5 free toppings. At Blaze and Pieology, they do free unlimited toppings. Maybe lotsa will change in the future, but I mean, I guess you really shouldn't be getting more than 5 toppings (because you'll get fat like me). \n\nLoved it, will be coming back often.",

      "text": "I have been to Lotsa about three times so far, and it has always been a great experience. I love these types of places, and I'm glad to see West Lafayette finally has a good make your own pizza venue. Also, for it to be located on campus is a dream come true. \n\nIf you've never been to one of these places before, the process is fairly simple - you pick a pizza dough, a type of sauce, your cheese, and toppings. They then fire the pizza in the oven for a few minutes. All pizzas are personal sized. Once pulled out of the oven, you can then add a finishing sauce/ingredient. (Such as olive oil, ranch, arugula, etc.)\n\nI happen to honestly really enjoy this location. Other make your own pizza places tend to have very thin crust in my experience, but Lotsa's dough tends to have more volume and is a nice compromise between super thick crust (which would probably take longer to cook properly) and paper thin crust (which ends up tasting like a cracker). \n\nThe selection of toppings is more than sufficient, and you can get pretty creative. I'm a big fan of Hawaiian pizzas, so I typically order red sauce with ham, pineapple, and ricotta cheese. Sometimes I do mushrooms instead. It's good no matter what! I've never found myself needing a finisher, but I may have to try the pesto someday.\n\nIt's an incredibly filling meal for the price you pay. For a make your own, prices run at $8 unless you add a premium topping such as shrimp. Compared to some of the other prices on campus, this is incredibly reasonable. If you weren't particularly hungry, and were just looking for a small bite to eat, I could even see sharing one of these between two people - it's a good amount of food.\n\nLotsa stays open late some nights, which is definitely nice if you're looking for a late night meal. I've only gone for lunch before, however.\n\nThe interior is clean and modern, and there is a good amount of seating. \n\nOverall, I am so glad to have Lotsa as an option on campus. I will definitely be returning this upcoming semester!",

Positives: you can build your own pizza or salad, or you can choose from specials they've already designed. It was a surprisingly fast cook, which was appreciated since I only had an hour for lunch. The size of the pizza was a surprise too, and the variety of crusts was a plus (regular, wheat or gluten-free). They have daily specials too, which knocks a couple bucks off. Overall the flavor of the pizza sauce was good and the toppings were tasty.\nDownside\nI observed the person on the cash register taking customer payments and moving food around when it came out of the oven. He did not have food handling gloves on then, nor later when I was leaving. \nI would visit again to try a different type of pizza.",

We enjoyed the smoked chicken with the broccoli salad and cucumber salad. You and pick and choose your own barbecue sauce. The sweet ending to our meal was that the owner stopped by and gave us 2 free desserts and thanked us for our business. Being from Kentucky we saw this a true southern hospitality.

They gave us samples of several sides to try and all were top shelf. Mac and cheese, and green beans were my favorites, but also LOVED the baked beans.

The order was everything that we've come to expect - fresh, tasty ingredients, good sauces, quick, friendly service, great prices. Ordering is by phone only (so we sat outside in our car and called the number on the front window). We were especially impressed by the consistent and genuine smiles, even under some very challenging circumstances.",

I tried out the chorizo, steak, shrimp and chicken taco's. They were all great, despite the fact that I'm not usually huge on corn tortillas. If you're going with a good appetite, I'd recommend at least 3-4 tacos. \nI tried some of their tacos with just cilantro and onion, and for some I amped it up with cheese and tomatoes etc. I kind of liked keeping it simple, I feel like you get the flavours more than when you load it with a ton of toppings. Their sauces also add a kick. \nThis is definitely a hole in the wall, cheap eats kind of place. The food is great and service is fantastic. \n\nWould I go back? Yes. \nP.S. on Tuesday's they only accept cash. All other days they take credit card as long as it meets a minimum, otherwise they add on 50 cents.",

I ordered the fajita mix with corn tortillas and a horchata. While we waited for our entrees to come, we had tortilla chips and salsa brought to our table. The salsa was actually quite good and didn't have that ketchup-like consistency that salsas and some other place tend to have. However, if you're not a cilantro person, I'm not sure you'll like the salsa cause there's quite a bit of it in the salsa.\n\nThe food comes out in a timely matter. My fajitas were delicious as was my fried beans and rice that came with my meal. The horchata was amazing. In fact, I had to resist the urge to gulp the whole thing in one go!\n\nOverall, an excellent authentic Mexican restaurant with an intimate feel and absolutely delicious food.

All were good.  Chicken, normally too dry/ tasteless to me was well seasoned in - i think- achiote.  Guac was good but maybe too watery?  They have aguas frescas and horchata.  We will back for sure- but probably just for take-out.",

      "text": "I've been to this location a few times now. It's definitely improving!\n\nAs others have mentioned, back in 2019 when it was new, it was painfully slow. Thankfully, it's not quite as bad anymore. However, if you show up around peak dining hours, you can expect to wait in the drive-through for 20 minutes.\n\nAs far as the food quality goes, Freddy's is pretty good for fast-food!  It's certainly a step above the top-3 fast food burger chains that everyone is familiar with. That being said, you're also paying a couple of bucks more!\n\nBurgers: Good! Freddy's has a unique technique when it comes to grilling their burgers. They smash them down super-thin, which creates a crispy crust around the edges.  It's a nice touch!  However, that also means the burger patties themselves are wafer thin, so it can feel like you're not getting a lot of actual volume for your dollar. \n\nFries: Bad. Freddy's only serves super-thin, plain, straight-cut shoe string fries. If you like that particular style, you're in luck.  However, I personally do not care for them. They're too thin, too bland, too boring. They remind me of the cheap, soggy, flimsy fries we used to get served at the school cafeteria. \n\nChicken: Decent quality, bland taste. Once again, the quality of Freddy's ingredients seems to be a notch above the competition.  They serve chicken tenders and breasts instead of the standard reconstituted nuggets served at other burger joints. While the quality is good, the variety is lacking. Looking for spicy chicken or something with a bit more flavor?  You wont get it at Freddy's.  Their spicy chicken is just the regular chicken with spicy sauce slathered on top of it.\n\nOthers: Freddy's also serves hot dogs, frozen custard, chilli, cheese curds, onion rings, etc - but I haven't tried them, so I can't review those items.\n\nOverall, if you're willing to pay an extra couple of bucks, I'd say Freddy's is probably preferable to the more established burger chains like McD's and Bking. However, it doesn't even come close to the flavor of specialty burger joints like AJ's or Five Guys.",

I'm not writing this after one bad experience, but two experiences that will cause me to never go back. On April 4 I paid for onion rings and got fries. Initially I decided that was fine and I would just deal with losing the extra $ I paid for them. After deciding a second later that I paid for the onion rings, so I should get them, I called them back to see if I could go inside to grab them since the line was so long (thanks COVID). The person on the phone was extremely rude and didn't care about anything I had to say - so I drove on. Tonight, I thought I'd go get some ice cream. After ordering and having it read back right to me and it being correct on the screen, the woman at the window tried giving me the wrong ice cream. I told her it wasn't mine (trying to save them from giving me the wrong food). She asked for the name and I told her. She said no this is what you ordered. I said it was right on the screen and it was read back to me correctly & I asked for the receipt. She gave me literally the worst look I've ever seen someone give any person and didn't give me the receipt. I said forget it and took the WRONG ice cream & left. Super sad about this because I love Freddy's and have frequented there since they opened last fall.",

They're situated in cute downtown Lafayette and are a small shop. Their products are delicious, though! I was blown away by the quality and flavors of the pies. \n\nSince my first visit, I've mostly purchased their mini pies and have tried Key Lime, Pecan, a mini fruit tart, and a mini and a mini cheesecake. My favorite so far is the fruit tart, since their custard is just out of this world. They also have a half-off section for what I assume was baked a day before. \n\nI highly recommend visiting this cute little bakery. You can't go wrong!",

      "text": "While planning a full day of exploration, I decided to stop in Lafayette for a cup of coffee.  This place popped up on my Yelp! search.  So, despite the title, I had \"coffee shop\" on my brain.  I grabbed a parking spot along the street (free) and headed inside.\n\nAfter passing a pair of small tables on the sidewalk, I saw the interior was rather small.  Some seating, but I got the impression it was more of a \"to go\" place than \"sit around and drink coffee all day\" place.  Don't get me wrong; there are tables and chairs and they do make some specialty coffees.  I only wanted a black drip coffee which is self serve and served piping hot (tongue scald Yikes!!)\n\nWhat I will say is that they do have a variety of baked goods and because it was still fairly early, I wanted to keep it light.  So I passed on all the rolls and breads and honed in on several macarons.  These are larger than most I've had and came in a variety of colors and flavors.  I liked that they would hold up over the course of the day without drying out.  \n\nI enjoyed each of them that I tried.  Light outside with a bit of crunch.  Tasty filling inside that paired well with the cookie part.  Really nice macarons.\n\nSo, although I really enjoyed my cookies, I have to knock a point off for the coffee.  I ended up driving to my next destination and was finally able to drink without losing taste sensation.  Fortunately, the coffee did have good flavor.\n\nReview #3000",

They have removed seating in order to install refrigerated cases to sell sushi to go - they call it Grab and Go. There is still a small amount of seating. There is a bar down the middle of the space with counter stools and a few tables along the windows. The tables are the only remnant of the pre-Covid dining room.  The concept is exactly what it says. You go to the cases, choose your sushi rolls, sides and drink, and pay at the front counter. Kudos to Sushi Don for turning a pandemic into an opportunity.",

      "text": "I am really disappointed. I previously gave Sushi Don a higher review because I really like this place. It's been a staple takeout place for me and my husband. However, I ordered the soy garlic chicken wings via GrubHub (through Yelp...) and got to the bottom of the pan and noticed some things that could have been just large chunks of garlic but they were peanuts. I have a peanut allergy (see note 1)The peanuts were not listed on the GrubHub menu or the menu pictures on Yelp that were added by the business owner. \n\nI called the restaurant just minutes ago. The person on the phone was friendly but a little flustered (which I understand. I didn't like being a \"Karen\" and it sucks to serve one too). He sympathized, having a nut allergy himself, and told me that he would try to contact the right people to get things updated and would make a note to give me free wings the next time I come. He also informed me that the pictures on Yelp have been outdated for months (see note 2) which is...not an excuse but explains how I got myself into my little conundrum.\n\nNotes:\n1. I understand that people may wonder why I didn't ask beforehand. My allergy is not severe, so I tend not to ask. Generally, I hope and expect people to keep that important information on their menu. Usually that's enough...I am going to get a bad eczema flare, that is for sure.\n2. My previous review recounted a different incident with the outdated menu. This was in either the spring or early summer. While I'm sure some would say I should have been wiser and checked the menu again, it is the business' responsibility to keep that up to date. The customer shouldn't have to go running for the right information.",

They've only had good experiences here and I was excited to try.\n\nWalking in, there was a very crowded waiting area and my friends and I walked to the \"please wait to be seated sign\" and waited patiently. 20 minutes passed and we haven't been greeted once by the host. We noticed that people who had arrived after us, were already getting seated. We were confused and had thought they had reservations but politely asked the host when we were next to get seated. He replied very short and with attitude, telling us that we had to wait and told us we should've checked in earlier. We never knew to check in because we were never told to, despite making eye contact multiple times with the host. We ended up waiting almost an hour to be seated, to which the host just cocked his head at us to follow him and didn't say a word when we sat down. He threw the menus down on the table and walked away briskly. We were upset by the host and his unprofessionalism but wanted to keep positive.\n\nOur waiter, on the other hand, was SO SO SO nice and amazing. Even though he was busy running to so many tables, he was very polite and genuinely wanted to make sure our experience was a good one. We ordered 6 rolls to share off the happy hour menu (50% off rolls). The sushi had pretty good flavor (although some tasted the same even though they were different rolls) and was decent for the price. Ended up paying around $13 each person (3 people total).\n\nNext time coming here, I plan to steer away from the very rude host. But I did enjoy the food and our waiter so maybe we'll try this place again when we come to visit.",

      "text": "Decided to try out their amazing specials with my girlfriend for date night. One thing to note is that the wait times are incredibly long for their happy hours because its 50% off. We waited 45 minutes for a table, but it was worth it! The selection is quite good as it ranges from your typical sushi rolls to some pretty unique chef specialties. I had the salmon meets tuna along with the spicy salmon roll and both were very fresh/well crafted. My partner had the Lionking roll and the Philadelphia roll which was also very good. Easily the best sushi in the Lafayette area, so remember to call ahead or plan to wait",

I'm not sure whether or not the management has changed or what has happened but I do not like the new \"grab and go.\" The sushi is pre-made and unfortunately it tastes pre-made :( For me there is a drastic difference in taste from their fresh sushi and the now pre-made sushi. I did have one of their poke bowls which was pretty good but not sure if it is worth the drive. I am so sad so say that I will not be returning, for at least the time being, with the new business model.",

It's hard to deal with the COVID issues, but they seemed to handle it well. My group had the grilled tenderloin, the tacos, and the southwest salad. I usually order the paradise salad, which never fails me. The southwest salad was very flavorful, with a spicy dressing I used sparingly on the side. I went with the lettuce and no pasta, which I think was a good call. I know they have some mixed reviews, but give them a try for nice outdoor seating. Would definitely go again!",

They have a wonderful seating area outside as well as a window room that gives almost the same effect. The food was decent; not the best but also not bad or anything. They have a fairly large menu with an option for anyone to be satisfied. The proce point is very good for the quality and quantity of food as you'll probably run about 35$ for 2 people with drinks before tip which is outstanding for the experience.

      "text": "Decent food at best, on average it is well below average, haven't had anything special here nor have heard anything too positive from a few friends. Service is hit and miss, bit perk is the extensive room in a classic American atmosphere and gorgeous backyard with outdoor dining. No other place in the area offers the view they got here. This is the place when no one cares about the food. Your boss is picking up the tab and that means the tap. They got the full bar with all the goods those dull meetings need to remedy. After all, meetings are where people keep minutes and waste hours right?! Despite prices to make it feel like it is about that family food times and a menu full of variety - it really is just enough to be an adequate backdrop for the annual whatever. Meats, sandwiches, salads, soups, apps, and drinks to satisfy. Again this isn't food quality like Red Seven, Bistro 501, Black Sparrow, Town & Gown (T&G has that salmon and pasta on a whole-nother level), even Cheddar's gives more eating fun. But this is the only restaurant in the whole area with a view! The back outdoor dining area is open to the country and pond, quite the vibe. I wouldn't ever pick this place with less than 10 people or sit inside. This is where the office gang ends up to relax and enjoy a Friday evening with drinks and a view.",

He was told that someone else had taken the food. Then they kept asking if he ordered through DoorDash which we did not. The bartender said she remembered me calling. They said they could remake the food if he wanted to wait. Not many other places are open at this point so he did.

Walt's is huge and has a lot of space, make of that as you wish, but it was awkward when the place was 3/4 empty and so vast. We ordered their sampler appetizer, which was good, but all of it was fried and crispy and tasted like a bunch of microwavable boxed appetizers heated up, except they were plated nicely and were expensive. The place was dark inside, had an odd layout, and had a really funky, strong smell to it, I kid you not, like chopped romaine lettuce (maybe it was all the wood?).",

Probably because they live out of town and this place gives the impression of being a high end restaurant. The management sucks and the food is sub par. Not much else I can say other than they should try to be more like their counterpart on the other side of town. If you're thinking about coming here, go to Walts other pub instead.",

Even so, looking around, I didn't see an area in the place that looked like a cozy spot to sit.  For a newly built restaurant, they should have done more for their ambiance.\n\nFood is average.  Reading the menu, it sounds great, but in reality it's nothing special.  Nothing terrible, but nothing great either.  I've eaten here twice and can't say I'd bother to return again.",

We ordered twice cooked pork with Chinese cabbage, eggplant with garlic sauce, and squid with Chinese pickled vegetables. It was nothing fancy; just freshly prepared and straightforward delicious. \n\nPicking up the takeout, we observed two things. First, it is mostly Chinese clientele, and the place was absolutely hopping, which we took as an excellent sign. Second, they started the food once we asked for the order - which was ok by us, as it was guaranteed fresh and not something that was warmed over or cooling off by the time we arrived. Can't wait to try more!",

      "text": "Food: 3/5\nService: 2/5\nPrice: 2/5\nBill handling: 1/5\n\nWe tried this restaurant today after having some authentic Chinese food craving. The store appears to be informal, meaning that family-owned and not professionally maintained (cleanliness, sticky table/floor etc). But as long as the food quality is good, the rest can stay behind the scene. \n\nWe ordered crispy duck and egg plant in garlic sauce. Egg plant in garlic sauce was decent, to be served with rice. The crispy duck wasn't bad but lacking flavors. The server never stopped by to ask how things were and they seemed busy taking care of their kids and eating lunch. I was going to ask for a salt but at the end I did not bother. \n\nThe bill handling was the major turn off. It was not printed so I could not understand the hand-written Chinese/English mixed scribble. The exact breakdown could not be understood but the final price which was ~$35. The crispy duck was $14.95 and the eggplant was $10.95 which I remembered from the menu prices. Therefore $26 roughly before taxes but how did it jump to the final $35? I found out later on 18% tip was added. I really don't appreciate when the automatic tip is assigned without notifications. \n\nIf the service and price would have been reasonable, I would have returned to try out other dishes but most likely I won't be returning. A bad first-time experience unfortunately.",

      "text": "I ate here once previously, soon after the restaurant opened. That experience was ok, but they were out of some things. This time I came at lunch by myself instead of with picky children. \n\nI was the only customer in here at about 1:20-1:50 Friday afternoon. I ordered the Century Egg with green pepper and the #138 - Home Style beef with chef special chili sauce.\n\nI'd never had a century egg and had wanted to try one for a while. It's a preserved egg that takes weeks to month to turn into a black version of its former egg self. Check out pics online if you've never heard of it. The yolk texture and flavor is delicious. The \"white\" (now translucent black) has a gelatin texture and look. It really tastes a LOT better than it looks. The chopped green pepper with it seemed silly. If I'm grabbing a slice of egg, why not slice the green peppers so they're big chunks? I don't get it. The sauce was very spicy, but good flavor. Was happy with this one.\n\nThe Home style beef is chopped almost to the point of being similar to ground beef. Plentiful crunchy celery bits (that Chinese food celery that somehow doesn't taste like celery but has that great crispness) were included. The chef special chili sauce was EXCELLENT. I will likely order another item with this sauce soon. Very good.\n\nThis is a *real* Chinese restaurant, so don't go here and order General Tso, (Please!!!)\n\nMy prior experience was ok, this one was very good. I recommend this place.",

We ordered from them through Grubhub and placed the order at 10:36pm because it says they stop taking orders at 10:45 pm, so I made sure we put in the order before that time. However, Shu Ge never bothered to update us about the order, instead of calling us or canceling the order, they straight-up ignored our order and never alerted the Grubhub system to cancel or modify order, as a result, we waited for 2 hours just to get told that they never made our food but still accepted the order to just let it sit in the system. When we finally got a hold of Grubhub customer service, they told us the whole story. At least we got a full refund and some meal credits, but people need to be aware of their business hours especially if you want to order online from them, they are not honest about their delivery policy and didn't honor the business hours they promised on their websites. Very disappointed!",

      "text": "Verdict: Definitely check this place out for their tacos\n\nLocation: Okay\nDecor: Good\nFood/ Drink: Great\nService: Great\nPrice: Great\n\nDetails: Although I live like 2 minutes from this restaurant, I've never had the pleasure of trying out their food. I would have given it a higher rating for location (close to some apartment complexes/communities), but it is out of the way for the greater lafayette/ west lafayette crowd. Went in on a saturday night at about 8pm to get some carryout. They had a karaoke night going, and a few families were in there there enjoying the karaoke. The server told me that 9pm would bring in a much younger crowd and that any type of karaoke is available. Getting that late a dinner would probably be too loud for my taste. They have a few parking spots available outside. \n\nThe Decor was simple but the place was clean. They had one of those wall mounted fireplaces and an aquarium too. Since it was karaoke night, they had the lights dimmed down and party/disco lights going(see picture). The server was very friendly to talk to and gave me recommendations on their food. He recommended the taco sampler (see pic) which is originally listed under appetizers. According to him, they are known for their cheap, tasty, authentic tacos. You get 7 tacos and that was a good price for $8.95. Service took about 20 minutes, but the karaoke kept me pretty entertained. The server also gave me a rundown of the place and told me that they love to host bigger groups and that they have a lunch buffet special. They are willing to accommodate the requests of larger groups in case that information might be of some use to you.\n \nOnce I got the food, put it in my car and started heading home, the 2 looooong minutes of driving was pure torture. The food smelled amazing! I could wait to get my hands on those tacos. Really! When I opened up the box, the dinner was all I thought it would be and more. They had some mild and spicy sauces on the side, and I really liked the spicy sauce. The tacos were really good. Can't believe I'd never been here before in spite of this place being so close. I definitely liked everything about this restaurant and will be back. I'm saving the 5 star rating for a 2nd experience, just in case this was a one time wonder. But definitely check this place out.",

It was more \"peppery\" than I've had at other places, but I actually really enjoyed the flavor.\n\nThey are known for their tacos and they did not disappoint.  My husband tried their Mexican style chicken, marinated pork, and chorizo/steak tacos with the green & red sauce.  He thought the chicken were best, but was super impressed.  They are small--so you can eat 4 - 6 if super hungry! \n\nI tried the shrimp fajitas and loved the sauce they used with the grilled veggies.  My only \"issue\" is that the shrimp still had their tails, which can make it a bit messy. \n\nThey have a nice kids menu & their cheese quesadilla was a generous portion.  \n\nThe decor was cute, they offer a taco buffet on weekdays for lunch (that we NEED to check out), and they had an actual changing table...like the ones in homes, which I very much appreciated.\n\nI think we found a new favorite for Mexican food on the West side!",

To take a twenty-minute car ride in a styrofoam box and still be crispy means they were made right. \n-Very filling! When I saw the side was tots, I thought I'd better order Onion Rings too..yeah, I couldn't finish them. \n-Speaking of onion rings, they were perfect as well. They were made in a smooth batter style and perfectly al dente so you don't rip the whole onion out when you bite. \n\nCons\n-Only con is now I'll want this place all the time and the location isn't ideal. \n\nGreat experience.

I believe Two Fellas Grill started in Kalamazoo, MI and is looking to expand to Purdue's campus.\n\nSo far there are only two tables to sit at, so you're most likely in for a standing wait if it's busy.\n\nThe target market is for those late night bar crawlers looking for post-bar munchies, but anyone that appreciates a good wrap should go.\n\nI ordered a steak wrap called \"The Rich\" and it was surprisingly better than I anticipated. I am usually not a fan of wraps, but this wrap had more food than expected, and the steak was cooked well. What added the most flavor was the tater tots inside. Yes, it was a bit greasy, so be cautious.\n\nGood news, it's open late, until 4am, but it also opens earlier during the day at 11:00, and they have a selection of breakfast wraps.\n\nIf this sounds like your kind of food, do try!",

The first item on the menu is also a safe bet, since sometimes they will forget to add ranch in the boilermaker even if u ask. Their honey mustard sauce is also very tangy and sweet.

It's not great or awesome or like WTF I need more. It's jut ok that hit my Greek fast food gyro need, a guy could go to Arby's and get the same meat. I say that because it's shipped in log Gyro Meat.\n\nWith that said. Friendly and good / decent service. I openly stated it was my first time there. And we received a warm greeting. I ordered the Gyro Supreme not noticing American cheese; that's my fault. Honestly should not be on the menu with American cheese. So ordering please read carefully. The gyros were both stuffed with meat and filling. Slightly stale pita despite flat top warming. We also ordered the hummus and pita. Same stale pita but the hummus was really really good.\n\nHere is my big deal; the preformed conical meat nonsense that they warm up day after day despite a slow day. Just stick it back in and it processed bulk meat. It isn't good at all. If you want a Gyro in Lafayette, please go to Arby's. We will try another time for a good dish. Maybe dinner is scratch made!? It should be.",

I have never experienced such bad customer service from a business owner, my husband always brings us food from there, but this was the first time I was able to order via phone call. I called at 3:44 to order a gyro dinner and he was already in a bad mood so I ordered as fast as I could, he told me the food would be ready in 10 minutes but then realized I ordered the wrong rice so I called again at 3:47 to change it and he said the rice was \"already made\". I asked him if he just made the lemon rice in 3 minutes just for me and he said \"yes\" which is a total bs... The rice is always pre-made, so I told him if he could change it because I didn't want that one, he said \"thank you\" and hung up on me... Not to mention that I was already outside the restaurant waiting in the car with my baby in the back seat (that's why I made the order through a phone call).",

      "text": "Akropolis was purchased and the food is slightly different now. The interior was somewhat redone in the past couple years after the transaction, but it's basically the same layout and vibe.\n\nI finally got back and had a gyro and fries. The tzatziki has been improved. The meat is pretty much the same. Pita was not very soft. Toppings were good quality - tons of onions and tomatoes.\n\nOn the whole this is an improvement as Meat and Tzatziki are the primary factors of import when judging a gyro.

Went here on a Saturday evening. Finding the place wasn't the easiest with no clear signs till you get right up at their doorstop. Parking was convenient. The restaurant wasn't packed and it is more of a self serve kinda place. I wanted to keep it simple and just got the lamb/beef gyro. The service was really nice and they were very friendly, which is a plus. The price for the gyro was decent, but can't say I was very impressed by the sandwich itself. It was definitely meat loaded, which is never a bad thing, but it felt a bit dry. The pita was softer than the meat itself. It also seemed like they were skimping on the tomatoes, onions and sauce, which didn't help with how dry the gyro tasted (I saw similar comments by other members on yelp). Maybe I'll give this place another shot and try the Moussaka next time.",

      "text": "This is my go-to place to eat because it's a genuinely good place to sit down for a meal and I will thrown down with anyone who says otherwise. (Seriously. Fight Me.)\n\nOn a more serious note, this is a one of my favorite places, period. For one, the food is good. It's cheap and you get a good pile of it. Overall, the shop carries the feel of a mom and pop shop. SUPER small and very narrow. It's not the best places for an intimate rendezvous unless you get take out. On the busy hours, everyone is squished together and there was definitely one time I had to climb over tables to get to the booth seat so my friend didn't have to. At the time, we were seated in the middle, between a few other groups on both sides, so it's not like I could scoot from one end of the couch. \n\nYou'll have trouble finding a seat or evening just standing in line to get your take out during the busy hours on the weekday. Yeah, you heard me, weekday. It's on campus and very generous with their take-out. It's delicious and filling, and I've had a lot of success with people who have never had Thai food before or are picky eaters when I bring them here. Additionally, I've lost count of how often I've seen people bring benefactors, alumni, and business representatives or guests here with all them still in their nice suits.\n\nThey service delicious, hot food you can pick up in between classes or on the way to work. Actually, that's how it was for me more often than not. When there wasn't enough time for me to walk and ride back to the dining halls and then to another class, I'd call Basil Thai with my order. Then I'd walk there from wherever I was (or if you're further off, I suggest taking 23/Connector and ride to Wood & River, it'll drop you on the same block), pick up my food, pay for it, and get back to class. \n\nIf you choose to eat there, it usually takes around half an hour. I usually finish in less. I'll lay it out to you. Any of the curries, noodles or stir frys (Pad Thai, pra-ram, etc) will usually take less than 10 minutes to get after you order. Moo ping or catfish or the chicken halves usually take 15 to 25 minutes. It's why when I'm in a middling rush, I go with pra-ram (the mildly spicy peanut sauce is really invigorating). When I have a bit more time, I like getting moo ping when I have more time. Unless they're having an off day in the kitchen (especially busy or backed up), it usually takes about that long whether you're sitting or getting take out.\n\nI have seen younger kids in there twice, but it's on campus and primarily swarmed by students and faculty. I'd suggest going during the non-rush times, primarily right at 11 AM (but it'll get super crowded around 12 PM) or after 1 PM for lunch, and before 6 for dinner. On most days, there's usually less people at those times. That is unless there is some kind of big event or career fair that day....Well, they don't take reservations, and it is one of the first places to get flooded. If you're looking for a place that DOES take reservations and you have a car, then get a reservation at Thai Essence, their sister restaurant up north. Nicer place, more extensive menu, and slightly more formal, but more same owner and same flavor.\n\nDon't be offended or surprised if they give you the receipt pretty much as they give you your meal. They're well aware that their place primarily serves people who are getting in, eating, then getting out. Eat your food, bring your receipt up to the front to pay. Very rarely will they pick up your check with your card/cash. 100% would recommend and am recommending. This is the place to go if you're being casual and would like impress somebody with your know-how of local eating places (if they don't already know, most do). It's a hole in the wall, but there's a reason it's so popular.",

I've also tried the pork skewers which were super delicious and I would recommend trying that. \n\nTheir bubble tea is also pretty good!

It is my go to dish and when the weather is cold, there is nothing better.  The broth is amazing with the green onion, garlic, cilantro, peanuts, sprouts, and noodles.  It comes in a huge bowl, so you may take some home.\n\nMy husband ordered the pad gra-tiam with pork.  It is basically covered in a garlic sauce served over lettuce and a side of white rice.   This dish is absolutely amazing. If I could bottle that sauce I would.\n\nWe've also tried their Basil Thai Fried Rice & Pad Thai.  While we normally don't get these dishes, I do enjoy them.\n\nOccasionally we will get their Satay with peanut sauce. It is chicken marinated in several spices served on skewers.  The peanut sauce isn't needed, but we love it.  A little definitely goes a long way!\n\nThey open at 11:30, except on Sunday when they open at 12.  Definitely give them a try.  If you don't like being on campus they also own Thai Essence out on 52--it's their \"fancier\" version and it is great as well!",

Social distancing between the all the tables, hand sanitizer near the entrance. My only concern related to COVID 19 is that a few kitchen staff weren't wearing their masks correctly (masks not covering the nose). The majority of the staff, however, were masked. We felt safe overall. Here's what we experienced:\n a. We got an omelette, a patty  melt, and drinks. Food was hot and fresh and tasty.\nb. Wait staff seem to be a fairly young crowd, with oversight from a few more experienced people.\nc. Tables were clean, but slightly sticky, which automatically means the good will be great.\nd. Fun to crowd watch. There are booths, tables, and a \"bar\" area with a few people dining solo.\ne. Pastry case near the register with pies, muffins, etc. Again, perfect for a diner! We didn't try any, but maybe next time.\nf. Menus are available with QR code, to minimize contact.  Paper menus also available.\ng. Good prices. Our check was under $20, before tip.\nh. Our server called us \"hon.\" \ni. What else is there to ask for?",

      "text": "Terrible service. I have never been to a place where servers actively look at you and do not care to attend to you. This was to the point I was ready to raise my hand like a child to get service. \nNot only did our table not receive things we ordered, we were also charged for those things. When we received our bill we waited for at least ten minutes for a server to come grab our check and at that point we just took our loss and left. \nI am extremely disappointed in the servers and the staff. You should never let a table go without drinks, especially when you are actively making eye contact with the customer, that automatically should tell you they need something. \nAbsolutely embarrassing and I recommend hiring all new staff if that's how they treat customers. I don't know who these girls think they are, but yes we did notice you both clean a booth together when it should be a single person job, after seeing us needing attention. \nI am absolutely just lost for words at how childish this staff is. We may be young but we all work in the industry and would have absolutely loved to treat a good server, but that was not the case. Great food, but absolutely awful service. \nAfter closing our own places of work, we wanted to support other small Lafayette businesses, but we will for now on take our business elsewhere.",

      "text": "My only trip to WD was for breakfast on a very busy Sunday morning.  The facility is small.  The tables are squeezed together tightly.  Unfortunately I sat in what ended up being a high traffic area for everyone.  So my chair and coat were constantly being bumped.  On top of that the dinner is very loud.  You won't find a relaxing meal here.  I also found it very odd that people had to enter in behind the counter area to access the restroom.  Obviously layout in this dinner could be improved.\n\nThat said...the meal was pretty good!  The menu is decent size.  There was enough of the usual breakfast items to pick.  I had the corned beef hash and eggs plus a one biscuit side of gravy.\n\nThe hash was very good - better than most places.  The hash didn't have a strong corned beef flavor.  However it was cooked to perfection - slight crisp on the edges.  I added plenty of Tabasco sauce which cane standard at the table.  The gravy was a bit bland.  I had to spice up with a lot of pepper.  The biscuit was split and \"smashed\" to the plate.  I've never had a biscuit that was so thin.  That created a little bit of a tough texture to cut - just odd.  I had the sour dough toast which was a bit dry.  I had hoped that it was made fresh on site.  I don't think it was since it didn't have a fresh and moist flavor.  My wife said her English muffin was probably the best she has had (fresh) at a dinner.\n\nI was impressed by the POS system used to take and process our order.  Very easy to do which created an Informative and fast check out.\n\nI was also impressed by the team working here.  I saw a lot of teenagers and 20 somethings working.  Very few older adults.  I assume this is a family business.  If so...they did an excellent job at hiring and training good employees.  Our waitress was very attentive as she could be on a busy day.  There was a lot of staff on hand to handle the rush.  I was most impressed with the bus boy who wiped the crumbs from the table into his hand instead of onto the floor.  This young man frequently washed his hands throughout the shift (as the sink was in view of the whole dining room).\n\nI definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a fast paced dinner experience.",

They tasted ok they just seemed \"unfinished\" compared to home fries i've had before. \n\nI do not like the coffee.

      "text": "Came in with pretty high hopes given the reviews but was a little let down. Purdue area has a ton of diners around, so there is a lot of competition for this one to live up to. I walked in on a Sunday around 10:30 knowing that it would be busy from the hungover college students as well as the early church crowd. It was packed to the walls and clearly did not have any form of managing it. People were literally standing inbetween tables, outside, and in each other's space. My buddy and I didn't want to wait, so we sat at the bar just to be constantly bumped and breathed on by people waiting for they're table. What brought the score up was the fact that the service was not too bad given the amount of people. Drinks were filled occasionally and orders were taken at a decent pace. The food was very ok. Nothing about my chorizo hash or my buddies breakfast burrito stood out. They were cheap and they tasted cheap rather than nostalgic like top tier diners. Given the other options, I would go somewhere else.",

      "text": "The Route 66 diner closed down and this new diner replaced it. They've made some much-needed updates to the interior. The prices are similarly low. It doesn't have the exact same menu as Route 66, but I think the owners of this place must have gotten some recipes from the Route 66 owners because the menu still has some of the signature items, including what used to be called the Drew Brees (now called the country steak breakfast), which is country fried steak, eggs, potatoes and griddled biscuits. The biscuits taste a little different, but everything else tastes pretty much exactly the same as it did at Route 66. They also have some appealing options that weren't on the Route 66 menu, including chicken and waffles and a breakfast sandwich on either a biscuit or croissant that comes with your choice of meat, including fried chicken (it's more of a chicken cutlet than Southern fried chicken, but it was still tasty and I appreciate the option for those people like me who don't eat pork). \nMy biggest complaint is that, compared to Route 66, the food takes forever to come out. But that's pretty minor and overall we're happy to have such a tasty, affordable place near our house. I expect we'll come here often.",

Except... some weekends. I don't know who's on the grill in the afternoon/evenings, but I've twice ordered a patty melt during those hours and it comes out not-grilled! Like on barely warmed bread! That's NOT a patty melt, people. So, it's hit or miss, but good enough I keep going back. But I avoid weekends later in the day.",

A table of old retired guys hanging out and drinking coffee like any reputable diner should have. \n\nCame here for breakfast with my son. \n\nHe got the kids pancakes and bacon. They were good. \n\nI got the biscuits and gravy with an egg on top since it's small town Indiana. The biscuit was good- moist, substantial, but not heavy and clearly homemade today. The gravy was also good, not overly greasy or heavy, hint of sweetness, and very good. \n\nPlus it's cheap-With drinks and tips it was less than $15.",

      "text": "Hubs and I went for the first time this morning based on a recommendation from his coworker. The SMALL town of Battle Ground IN is only a 10 minute drive from our home, and we were feeling adventurous, so we headed out. It's a seat-yourself, home-cookin', small-town, dinning hall with miss-matches chairs, and family pictures, and memorabilia on the wall. There was an all-you-can-eat buffet today for $11, manned by a student of Hubs (He's a teacher, and she's the sweetest little thing ever!) but we opted to order from the menu. They have a decent selection of well loved foods. And my half B&G/ half hash browns all cover in gravy was really good . Hubs has the Bacon Omelette and it was enormous, and though he enjoyed it a lot, he couldn't finish it. \n\nThe place is filled with locals who visit often, and just like a small town, everyone knows everyone, and owner Stephanie Bailey knows most of them. We were definitely not from around those parts but we never felt out of place. At one point I told my husband he looked like Jane Goodall lol. The owner and the other employees were all friendly...even during the after church rush that we witnessed. \n\nThe whole experience was great. The food, the prices, the hodgepodge of decorations covering every available area in the place was all worth it. I will go again, and I recommend taking the time to visit.",

      "text": "One of only two (possibly three) restaurants in a very tiny town, but a good one! Fiance and I came here for lunch just as they were switching shifts. The decor is a cross of country meets cafeteria. Sunny was our waitress and she was as nice as can be. Very eager to steer us in the right food direction! We got the BLT with a side of homemade coleslaw and a cheeseburger with a side of onion rings. My fiance loves burgers and he was very impressed with the freshness of the burger as well as the bun! Based on our lunch, I would imagine their breakfast is equally as good and I wish we had arrived just a tad earlier so we could have indulged in that meal (as well as the musicians that play every Saturday morning). After we finished eating, the cook came out to talk with us about the area. Very nice guy and a good cook too! If you're ever passing through this area (we stopped for the Tippecanoe Battlegrounds) keep going a bit further down the road and you'll hit this place!",

There are several options to choose when you build your bowl, which was great for my family, everyone customized to their liking. Between the 4 of us we had the Beef Shawarma, Chicken Shawarma, and Falafel. It was all cooked to perfection, the falafel was still crispy even after the drive home. The bowls were filled generously, and all of the toppings and sauces were tasty. When I was eating my bowl, it seemed like it was unending, a very large amount of food.\n\nI ordered online through their website, and they were putting the finishing touches on the bowls when I arrived 15 minutes later. The website was very easy to use, and it allowed us all to personally customize exactly what we wanted. The restaurant space is take out only. Both the employee and owner were very friendly and passionate about their food. My family can't wait to try it again.",

Both were soooo delicious! The honeysuckle latte had the perfect amount of sweetness with a light honey taste and lovely hone\nysuckle aftertaste. The sacred hippie is the sweet version of a dirty chai. It had whipped cream with a caramel drizzle and toffee sprinkled on top. The barista described it as \"dessert in a cup\" and boy was she spot on. If you like a little coffee with your cream and sugar then this is the drink for you, but if you take your coffee black/unsweetened then maybe order something else. \nOverall, we loved the coffee and atmosphere and are looking forward to visiting again.",

      "text": "My favorite beverage depot in the area besides the awkward location not on the way to anywhere. Sacred Grounds is my spot in the city, free WIFI making it easy to stretch out in this eclectic reborn urban atmosphere. There's a great menu with original drinks, tasty real foods cooked up not heated up in a box, and really cool staff eager to please and drip an off menu drink as you like. All making good not just trading cash for caffeine but a wonderful reflection on the origins of this place also depicted in the graffiti. The only things missing are a strong selection of deserts like cheesecake nibbles, chocolates, and indulgent blended magic like Grayhouse does with their frozen hot cocoa liquid bliss. I've sampled many things here. The breakfasts are fantastic, wow proper biscuits and gravy! Makes The TripleXXX Diner look like bad Cracker Barrel. The wraps are amazing too. My usual was a Dirty Chai which sent taste buds a tingle and heart to palpitations. Last fall the pumpkin latte was legit pure riches. Lately I've realized Trent is a master: the Atomic Pony, lavender and white cocoa I think it is, when Trent makes it I cannot think of a better brew in the county. As my check-ins shows I might have a problem! It's a bummer we haven't had live shows this year. Shawn McDonald made for the best concert I've been to a few whiles ago because I was 15 feet from the stage and didn't have bleeding ears after. I would really like a Sacred Grounds 2 on campus: Hebrews? Espressoul? Brew Unto Others? Latte Say Grace?",

We ordered a grilled cheese and quesadilla and both were extremely delicious, filling, and flavorful. Even though it's a cafe, the food was restaurant quality. They took their time with our coffee making sure it was just right and put in extra effort with the whole process--pouring slowly, decorating with latte art, and bringing it to our table. In other words, I felt like our food and coffee was made with love. I really appreciate the Christian element too; the subtle Bible quotes and crosses made me feel at home. The inside is cozy in general, though I find the ordering side of the place much more aesthetically pleasing than where the couches are (what initially made me unsure of going). I wish this place had better hours so I could come more often!",

The store interior is very homy and cozy. There is brick detailing, and many tables to use to study, catch up with a friend or read a book. \n\nIn addition to a wonderful interior, the coffee itself is delicious. Each beverage is handcrafted, and all of the coffees/drinks are made with care. My personal favorite is the Milky Way, an espresso with milk, and lots of whipped cream. The baristas are always so welcoming and friendly! \n\nAt most coffee shops, coffee can easily be $4, if not $5. At Sacred Grounds, coffee is reasonably priced! In addition, Sacred Grounds offers a 15% student discount and frequent visitor card.\n\nI highly recommend Sacred Grounds if you're looking for a new place to grab coffee, study or meet up with friends!",

I'm used to 3 minutes max on waiting for a latte in Philly. \n\nWhen I arrived at Sacred Grounds there was no line and the woman behind the counter was doing something. The shop is cute but there is a large sitting/gathering room on the right side of the building. There was only one employee and it was around 7:35 when I arrived. \n\nIt took around 5 minutes for her to finish whatever she was doing behind the counter as I awkwardly stood in the shop. There was no indication of where to stand to queue to order. Finally, she called me over and I ordered a small latte with whole milk. It took another 5 minutes for her to grind beans and make the drink. \n\nIn between my waiting, another woman came in and grabbed a cup that the cashier had already made. I guess you can order ahead? If you can, I'd definitely recommend it cause it took wayyyy to long to get a coffee and I was cranky.\n\nOverall, I won't be back, Nothing too interesting which is too bad cause I love to support small shops.",

My favorite drink is the chai tea latte, and I love that it comes at a drinkable temperature and I don't have to wait for it to cool for ten minutes. I always bring homework or a book with me, and it's the perfect atmosphere for that-- quiet, cozy, and productive. My only complaint is that there aren't a ton of convenient wall plug-ins, so I'd recommend charging your laptop beforehand, or just be willing to search for a plug-in",

The breakfast menu was sparse (scrambled eggs, egg burrito, biscuits and gravy, oatmeal, and yogurt were the only offerings) but we really enjoyed the flavor of our eggs w mushroom, onion, cheese, and sausage and the biscuits and gravy. \n\nWe especially liked the coffee, which was tasty (we had a mocha and a peppermint mocha) and we agreed it was better than other mochas we've had elsewhere.  The style is \"order at the counter\" and they bring it to your table. There were some tables of people working w papers and laptops about and other tables with big groups of chatting people. It was quiet (Monday morning at 9:30 between semesters at Purdue) so we were able to enjoy our conversation without struggling to hear each other.\n\nThe atmosphere was very interesting, with reclaimed items of all types repurposed for the decor. I gave 4 stars because of the narrow menu and also, our food wasn't served hot. I'm sure if we had asked, the pleasant and helpful staff would have taken care of it for us. We weren't excited about our menu choices when we placed our orders but agreed that everything tasted great. So ultimately, we were very happy with our breakfasts.\n\nI would definitely return if I wanted a reasonably-priced egg breakfast with excellent coffee and low ambient noise. And, because I'm someone who spends a lot of time sitting in restaurants w my computer, this would be a perfect spot for me to hang out. \n\nP.S. There were some awesome-looking cookies that were freshly-baked. I didn't try them, but it's another plus to this interesting spot.",

I called ahead and said we'd be there in about 25 minutes, and the person who answered the phone said he would have our order ready when we arrived. When we got there, we just pulled into one of the marked spaces for curbside pickup, and they came out and took our payment then brought the food right to the car. So easy! And OMG THOSE SANDWICHES! They were DELICIOUS - I got the vegan grilled cheese and my husband got a weekly special sandwich with mushrooms. Both were FANTASTIC and came with really great crunchy potato chips. This will be a regular stop for us on our way to and from Bloomington. I highly recommend this place!",

I am not a vegetarian, but all the food I've had so far has been very satisfying. I especially liked the jackfruit torta. I've never had jackfruit before and had no idea it was so good.

But, NOT Escape Velocity. All 5 beers on tap were perfect. Perfect, you ask? That's a pretty brazen statement. But, yes, I will repeat myself, PERFECT.  Besides excellent beers, the brewery has a super cool atmosphere with fun colorfully painted walls, very comfortable seating, and the owners & partner slinging out the beers are really friendly and knowledgeable about their beers, of course. Beers sampled: IPA, pilsner, Kolsch, porter and a hoppy Belgian wit.",

We each had the three course meal of salad, soup, and sandwich. A roll was served with the salad. Along side of the sandwich was a strawberry, a broccoli pasta salad and an amazing, tart mini lemon cake. We were offered take out containers for our sandwiches. For a very reasonable price we got multiple meals. The service was friendly. So pleased we could help others by dining out. We'll definitely be eating here again.",

      "text": "This is, hands down, the BEST restaurant in the whole of Lafayette/West Lafayette. We've been there on many occasions one of which was with a very large group that included children too. \n\nRemember that proceeds from this restaurant go to run the charity organization run by the owner. And all staff there are volunteers who've benefited from the charity at a certain point in their lives. So, they'll only be open for limited business hours. \n\nThe very fist thing I noticed was the ambiance. It is has an exceptionally charming country feel to it. If charm and character in a place are your type of thing, then go there!\n\nOn the rare occasions when I ordered something which they ran out off (it happens in a small not-for-profit business like theirs) they'd always get a replacement which was just as fresh and delicious. Sometimes, they'd give over compensate and I'd get a huge box with food to go that I couldn't finish.  It comes in handy when you don't wanna cook.\n\nThe manager, Anna, custom made the entire menu for our party. They'll even make a separate menu for children if you request it.   \n\nThey're very vegan and vegetarian friendly. So, if you have a group with dietary restrictions they'll always come up with a creative menu that works well for all.  \n\nI highly recommend their three course afternoon tea. Their portions are generous. I wouldn't recommend eating lunch before tea.  \n\nAnd there's a chic little boutique upstairs too. So for anyone who likes to shop, check that out. It's worth it.",

The servings are enormous- seriously, split an entree. My favorite is actually the spinach salad, they have this onion dressing that I love. I heard a server say that the spinach salad is what they're known for, and I'm not surprised. They always have different soups available and offer sweetened and unsweetened tea. The hours are a little bit weird, they're not open too often- usually I go Saturday for lunch. I'm not exactly sure how the charity affiliation works, but I know that a lot of the proceeds and I think all of the tips go to programs for feeding the hungry- they must be subsidized somehow and there's a short explanation in the entry if you're curious. It's cheap and delicious, I 100% recommend it on the food alone.",

I usually get it delivered, however, it takes them over an hour to deliver them to my place even though I don't live very far from them. Although it is one of my favorite pizza places, it is pretty pricey. I would say 2 XL pizzas would be around 50 dollars. I will have to try their other pizzas in the future!",

      "text": "My friends and I go to Purdue. We decided to try Greek's Pizzeria on a whim. At first glance, I thought the restaurant was take-out only but turned out to have a cute and cozy dine-in area. Upon entering, we were greeted with the sweet smell of pizza baking! We ordered three different pizzas. We ordered both Sunday specials for $12 each (one came with sticks and the other came with two toppings) and we ordered a small Roma pizza. We thought the Roma pizza would be enough for two people but turned out not to be. Fortunately, the chef had no problem in whipping us up another medium merely 20 minutes before closing. I was very impressed with his daft customer service. The pizzas shined in both the sauce and the cheese components. The sauce was well-made with a rich and somewhat sweet sauce. The cheese was thick and gooey which I preferred. The dine-in area had a TV with a gameshow playing. We were very invested into the show which added to the overall experience. But that's not all, the cream of the crop was that they sold Triple XXX root beer! Overall, great eatery with what seems a rich history. Thank you!",

The pickup was contact-free and awesome. When I entered the restaurant, there were tables marked for pickup and you just had to find your order and pick it up! \n\nWe got a Crispy Chicken with Garlic Sauce & a Chef's Special Stir Fried Chicken. I was a little worried that the dishes may be too dry or too oily - but none of that was true! I absolutely loved both the entrees, they were perfectly cooked & still warm!! They sent a rice box with each of the dishes. Their packaging was super nice so that if any of the sauces leaked, they would still be in the packet, which wouldn't seep through. \n\nThe prices were a little bit steep, but definitely worth it because the quantity is a lot, so you can either share with multiple people or eat the food over multiple meals. \n\nWould 10/10 recommend you to go try it out if you haven't already!",

      "text": "Earlier this week, I had the pleasure of dining at Peppercorns Kitchen.  It was among the best Chinese food I've eaten, and one of the dishes was in the Top 10 off all-time.\n\nLet's get two things out of the way:  one, the restaurant's internal signage is in Chinese.  The bulk of the menu is Chinese, with (very) short English descriptions (but lots of pictures).  Even the sign that usually says \"Please wait to be seated\" is in Chinese.  At least, that's what I'm guessing it said, based on where it was located.  But based on how much Chinese I speak, it could have just as easily read \"Free Beer Tomorrow\", or \"Tonight's Movie is 'Crazy Rich Asians'\".\n\nThe point being, it's a CHINESE restaurant.  While I hate to use the word \"authentic\", for any culture I'm not a part of (Chinese, Mexican, hipster), I'm going to guess this is the real deal.  But it's Chinese first, and you have to figure it out.\n\nTwo, the service is different.  Not better, or worse.  Different.  I've seen this in similar restaurants.  Multiple servers.  Dishes served in the \"wrong\" order.  Dishes coming out at different times.  An indifferent attitude toward cleaning off tables.\n\nSo now you know.  If either of these bother you, don't go.  They aren't going to change, and I'm sure there's a Chang's somewhere nearby that will suit you better.\n\nBut if you have an adventuresome palate, this is your spot.\n\nFour dishes were sampled:  Chinese Broccoli with Garlic Sauce, Xinjang Style Sautéed Beef, Chicken with Sichuan Pickle, and from the \"Specials\" menu, the Cauliflower dish.\n\nThe broccoli was perfectly cooked, tender, with a gentle garlic sauce.  It's not overpoweringly pungent, just a great taste.  It was very well-done, and was the worst of the four dishes.\n\nBecause the other three were outstanding!  So good that a dish that would be one of the best at another restaurant was simply an also ran here.\n\nThe Chicken was a stir fry of ground chicken meat, spices, and chopped pickle.  Don't think cucumber garlic dills; this was more of a preserved pepper.  Heat, not vinegar.  The dish was served with steamed bao-type buns, and the bland buns helped temper the spice.\n\nThe Beef was amazing.  It was strips of beef and onions, sautéed with a delicious sauce.  The sauce caramelized a bit, so there was a bit of sweet, then a fullness of flavor hits.  Unctuous, rich with umami.  Even the onions by themselves were delicious, given this sauce.\n\nBut the best was the Cauliflower.  Served in a small wok, over a small burner, the cauliflower, peppers, and pork belly are sitting in a small pool of enhanced oil.  That begins to bubble and pop, so you stir the dish as you're eating it, ensuring the belly crisps up, the cauliflower sears a bit, and the Sichuan Pepper infused into the oil begins to flavor everything.  As a result, your tongue will get a bit numb (side effect of this pepper).  This is one of the best dishes I've eaten, with the three kinds of cauliflower (yellow, green, white) aggressively spiced, with the delicious pork belly providing a kick of salt and delicate fat.  The heat kicks in after a few minutes, and when you finish, you'll realize you've eaten a lot of peppers.  It is an amazingly flavorful dish; one of the best things I've ever eaten.\n\nMy apologies for not taking pictures.  Frankly, I was too busy eating to pay attention to preserving the experience.  It's that good.\n\nSo why only 4 stars?  Hey, the food is a solid 5 stars--really outstanding flavors, plated and presented nicely.  But uncleared tables are unappetizing.  So while I can certainly deal with it, it does come into the rating.  Same with spotty service.  I don't care, if the food is great (and it is), but it does come into the rating.\n\nSo 4 stars to some of the best Chinese food I've ever eaten.  I'll absolutely eat there again.  And again.",

The only thing we are dissatisfied is that they included 18% tip on the receipt. And I saw many people struggle with the same issue.\nI argued this tip with one of the server, and she told me they have been doing this for a long time. (Whaooo?? This is not an excuse for not telling us)\nWell, this is not what we do thing in California \nService fee is not mandatory by law (I believe this is true in every state?), and if the restaurant requires customers to pay 18% tip, the restaurant must inform customer ahead of time (not when they get the bill).\nYes, whatever I said is by law. Please search it up yourself and correct me.\nBtw, I don't see any pleasure service in this restaurant that I would pay 18% though. \nAt lease server in LA would help me put the left over in boxes for me‍‍‍",

      "text": "Nice authentic Chinese Szechuan restaurant. They have a very diverse menu with ~10 options for every meat and vegetable option, not including chef specials or appetizers. The restaurant itself is very clean, neat, and there is plenty of seating. I returned last night (after 2 years of not going) and it has greatly improved. I was hesitant to return because the service wasn't as good and the food was mediocre for the price. This time, I was very pleased with the food. The price was still a bit steep for me, so it's more of a \"treat\" than an everyday restaurant. Prices average almost $14-15 per entree and rice is not included ($1). \n\nWe ordered the spicy wontons, crispy chicken in garlic sauce, and shredded pork. Spicy wontons were only ok - the skin was a little too thick, the stuffing was under seasoned, and the sauce was only ok. I probably wouldn't order again. Definitely spicy. Crispy chicken in garlic was delicious! Not overly greasy and the sauce had a good mix of sweet and sour. Tasted like a homemade sauce with Chinese vinegar, ginger, and other great spices. Our favorite dish was the shredded pork in garlic sauce. It comes with tofu skin and sliced green onion to make a mini burrito. Amazing combination of flavor and texture. Would definitely order the chicken and pork again. \n\nThe service was also on par. Staff are constantly circulating to clear plates, refill waters, and get boxes/check. It was amazing, especially since we needed water for our spicy wontons!\n\nOne bad thing that I dislike for all restaurants - 18% added gratuity included. I found it very strange, especially since we were only 2 people... Luckily, I feel like the experience deserved a good tip, but I just don't like it forced on me, ya know?\n\nTLDR - Delicious, but pricey food. Great service. Can't wait to try more! 18% gratuity even in groups of 2.",

Overall flavor was honestly fairly average for Chinese food. The spice was there, but again nothing that stood out. The price was really what blew me away. 14 bucks for a single entree at any takeout chinese restaurant is highway robbery considering the fact that it was the same quality as panda. I could have saved money, gotten similar quality, and more food elsewhere.",

      "text": "When Peppercorns opened the food was amazing. I've noticed a slow decline in quality over the past few years. Sadly Chinese restaurants in Lafayette seem to follow that trend.\n\nI ordered take out on Wednesday for myself and a friend. Pan fried noodles were far from pan fried. I didn't make a fuss over it because in the past pan fried or not they were tasty. Tofu/pork was 95% tofu, 2% garnish, and 3% pork. The Chinese buns and sticky rice were the only really good item we got. I'm very easy to make happy if the food is good. I can't say that here. The mains tasted exactly the same. It was very bland as well. Blindfolded I'd be hard pressed to tell which was which.\n\nI regularly eat out or bring home Chinese food. Top 3 cuisines easily. Last 2 times I had food from here I had thought the dishes tasted very similar but I gave benefit of doubt. There is no doubt now. That was the last time I will be ordering anything from here. It was a very expensive plate of rice and buns. The mains were not edible past a few bites.",

      "text": "Summary: Good Chinese food\n\nWe'd been in Lafayette for a week and were really craving some authentic Chinese food so tried this place out on a whim. \nFirstly, it's a nice, spacious restaurant, clean, well lit with lots of seating. \nOur server was polite enough, but didn't go out of her way to make us feel welcomed (I think there may also have been a slight language barrier). Sometimes it was a little tricky trying to get their attention .\n\nThe menu has some good choices, of which we tried the following:\n1. Hot and sour soup - my parents loved it. My mum can be very picky when it comes to her food (being a great cook herself) but she commended the soup. \n2. Dumplings - they were good but more oily than what I'm used to. \n3. Seafood fried rice - delicious, hefty portion! I don't usually go for fried rice as I prefer plain rice or noodles with the side dishes but the fried rice was really great. Almost a meal in itself I would say. \n4. Sizzling fish fillet dish - strangely enough it wasn't sizzling when it came to our table, not sure why? But the dish was your standard fish fillet, nothing spectacular. \n5. Mapo tofu - this is a tofu with minced pork dish that we invariably end up getting. I can't say this is the best mapo tofu I've had, but definitely not the worst either, a happy medium perhaps? One thing I noticed though is that there was quite a discrepancy between the amount of tofu vs. minced pork in the dish (the latter being more sparse). Otherwise good (a little oily!)\n\nWould I go again? Probably. Our only main issue I would say is that they did add a 18% service charge to the bill. We weren't exactly thrilled with our service to start with, but this is something to watch out for.",

      "text": "Here is the break-down of different factors: \n\nFood quality: 5/5\nThis is an authentic chinese restaurant. You should be able to find that out as soon as you look at the menu. Do not expect to get american style (panda express-like) \"orange chicken\" or such entree in this place, you won't get that. I've tried many items here from unregular ones like pork-intestine pot to more regular ones like lamb saute or crispy chicken. Very good quality. \n\nService: 1/5 to 5/5 (it varies)\nThe service part can get better. But the 18% mandatory tip ruins it. There is no reason for waiter/waitress to earn the tips because it's already there.  I'm not a business owner so I do not know, but I would rather get rid of the mandatory 18% tip and strive for better reviews on yelp/google hence attract more customers. It just ruins it, please.\n\nFinal rating: 3/5",

We were both craving burgers and decided to try some out. We ordered poutine fries as a starter. It did not disappoint! The fries were crispy and were covered with just enough cheese. There was plenty to share between the two of us and we even had some to take home. \n\nNow the burgers were just okay. I favored the jalapeño burger over the Bryant, however both burgers were greasy. The jalapeño burger had too much sauce. I would recommend asking for the sauce on the side. \n\nI would come back, but I wouldn't order a burger. The overall atmosphere was nice and the waiter was friendly.",

They were more than happy to offer us curbside pick-up and kept the whole transaction contactless. \n\nFood:\n1) Their superfood salad comes with a red wine vinaigrette. The portion is great, but it was a very dry and stale salad. It was lacking in shaved parmigiano, pear, and dates. Definitely needs more dressing for the amount of shaved brussels and cabbage in there! I just would not recommend this dish for $8. \n2) The Impossible Burger is good, but it just seemed a bit \"flat\". Perhaps it could do with more lettuce, dijonnaise, cheese ? I'm not able to pinpoint the exact issue, but it's not a juicy burger, which is what I hoped for. \n3) The Impossible lasagna was my first taste of a vegan lasagna. This, I would recommend! It was flavorful, had the right balance of cheese and \"meat\", and it was a good portion size. The pesto sauce that comes with it was super yum!",

I'm a burger fanatic so I went with the Bryant burger, and I'm \nglad I did.\n\nThe burger was cooked perfectly and very juicy, and the cheese melted perfectly over the patty. The bacon was thick the way bacon should be, with added onion straws for additional crunch. The fries were another big plus, which I've found in most restaurants like this, the burger is great with mediocre sides.\n\nFor $14, I have no complaints and plan on coming here each visit home!

The menu has something for just about anyone too with the variety of burgers, pasta, and steak/chicken options. I had The Bryant Burger, and my date had the ravioli. The burger is exceptional in flavor, and one of the best overall burgers I've ever had. The ravioli was also presented well and tasty. They have a great draft beer selection from local breweries too which is great. Overall price is about 50$ with tip and drinks for 2 which I think is very appropriate for the quality of the food and service.",

The lettuce was very cold as was the dressing- both accentuated each other very well.  The extra cold cut the rough wasabi edge so you could really enjoy the flavor.\n\nOur waiter was friendly and professional.  The hostess team seemed confused once the place out really busy.  We had to remind them our party of 4 had been waiting while other parties of 4 walked in and were seated ahead of us.\n\nOverall...an excellent experience!  Give it a try!!",

I went out with a couple friends and we played some games, ate some food, and had a great time. The staff was friendly, and the prices were affordable. We loved the selection of games. However, at the end of the night, while we were getting ready to leave, I talked to one of my friends. I asked her out, and she friendzoned me at the front entrance to the place. Very sad! So I don't know when I'll come back, just because of the hurtful memories, but it really was a nice place. I suggest going here with a date that doesn't friendzone you!",

      "text": "My all time favorite location for a double date with my wife and friends!\n\nThere is a solid food menu with some basic pub entrees, along with a great beer selection. \n\nThere were hundreds of table top games to choose from (from popular party games like Cards Against Humanity to intense RPG's). We chose \"Settlers of Catan\" and none of the 6 in our group had ever played. Within 15 minutes the waiter had the game set up for us and had explained all of the rules. We jumped right in and had a blast for all of 3 hours!\n\nThe major selling point here was having a helpful staff member available to be a game guru when we had questions. Setting up a never-before-played game with friends can be a daunting task otherwise. \n\n5 STARS all the way.",

      "text": "This is such a cool new place in Lafayette, and I absolutely love that it exists. Ever since I was a kid, I have loved playing board games with friends and family. Video games are great, but there's something about the shared experience of sitting down and talking and laughing over a board game that I just absolutely love. \n\nThis location is an amazing place to take part in a night of board games. I have been three times already this semester, and I plan on going back plenty next semester. \n\nEssentially, you walk in, choose a table, and choose a game. There's a sitting fee of about $5, which is more than reasonable. When you consider that you could easily spend 3-4 hours here, $5 is minimal compared to say a movie or a bar. You can swap out games as many times as you would like. \n\nThey also offer food and drink. I have had a few of the bottled ciders they offer, and they've all been very nice. Drink prices are about average. The food prices have recently decreased, and the food consists of sandwiches and snacky appetizers mainly, which makes sense for this type of venue. I've never had a bad sandwich here. \n\nThe staff are very friendly, and they're more than willing\nto help teach you the rules of a game. \n\nOverall, I highly recommend going here. It adds something new to the area, and there is a lot of fun to be had.",

We were seated at a shared table, because apparently it's already a very popular place.  We played a 2-player game, and were given great advice on a game new to us, as well as some assistance getting started. We were also instructed about the white flag we could use in the event we wanted to invite others to our table to join us for a game. We sampled some sandwiches, which were great and some beer and cider, which were equally great. Staff were friendly and knowledgeable and we even made some new friends. Best of all, it was kid-friendly, which means we don't have to have a babysitter to visit again. Looking forward to playing there again soon!",

There are a few places around town that hold game competitions and game nights, but if you want something a little more relaxed, then Merlin's is for you. All you have to do is walk on in, pick a game, and start playing!\n\nThey have a nice variety of games both adult favorites and kid friendly, ranging anywhere from simple classics like Scrabble to more adventure cards like Munchkin. There is a five dollar sit in fee, meaning you pay five dollars and can play as much as you want. They also offer food and alcohol. Their grilled cheese sandwiches are the best! \n\nThe staff are super friendly and may just pull up a chair, chat, or show you how to play a game. They are always willing to teach! If you fall in love with a game, be sure to check out the game racks in the corner to see if they have in stock and take it home with you. \n\nLocated in downtown Lafayette, parking can be tricky, so you may wind up parking a few blocks away, but it's worth it. In the evening, parking may be easier to come upon. I'd recommend this place for game lovers of all kinds. No matter what games you're interested in, you're sure to find something you'll love.",

      "text": "This was our first visit since they reopened the dining room after the COVID-19 shutdown, and oh my goodness. (They're operating with 50% of their dining room roped off.) It's like they spent the entire shutdown improving the quality of their food. I had a cabeza taco, and it was exquisite. Tender, flavorful. Wow. And the (crispy... is there any other way?) tripitas taco was everything a tripitas should be. Texture, flavor and even quantity was perfect. My wife had a (less adventurous) taco al pastor, which was positively heaping with meaty goodness. Generous portions of meat, fresh, fresh, fresh. Even the tortilla chips and salsa were among the best I've had. We topped it off with a camarones a la diabla, which had the perfect amount of heat and flavor. I didn't think Taco Rico could get any better, but they truly outdid themselves this round. We may just be back, y'think?",

      "text": "One of the better Taco spots in the city, ua three guys dropped in around 8:00 p.m. for a weekday dinner to find a friendly and accommodating staff, lovely atmosphere, and large menu with all the fantastic options however horchata was sadly missing. We got a smattering of dishes all different. My BBQ beef was quite nice, missing tangy flacpes American BBQ boasts but tender great along with the rice and guac. The others are well too tho two muttered about how dry some of their meat was and unedible the chips were. Maybe a better spot for a rual lunch and dinner times! My one friend was very excited to come here again so guessing there's plenty here to make a tasty time.",

I did take off one star, because the salad barely had any shrimp in it, and they were very small cut up pieces. The shrimp fajitas may be more worth the price than the salad. We would come back :)",

Service is pretty standard here. They do sell bottled coke, which is always a treat. Only real bummer about this place is that you can't get a margarita! \n\nMy friend had the chimichanga, which was enough for 3 people. She took most of it home. The guacamole here is out of this world! It tastes so fresh. Some of the best I have had. Worth it! \n\nThis time, I ordered a carnitas sope and a steak taco. The fillings are always flavorful. If you are looking for fresh Mexican food, try this place. They don't drown everything in white cheese!",

Food is served fast, servers are friendly, and the general atmosphere is positive. I had the Al Pastor and the Carnitas tacos- both are juicy and delicious, and the Al Pastor has just a little spiciness to compliment the acidity of the pineapple. The tacos are street size, and you order them individually, so they are perfect to get a variety of flavors.",

The tacos were some of the best I've had within the Purdue vicinity, and while I would have appreciated more toppings within the rice (like some sort of veggie), I'll take what I can get. The other complaint is that each taco cost $1.95, which was a little steep in my opinion. However, the asada meat and horchata were delicious, I will for sure be coming back.",

      "text": "Definitely would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great, authentic, Mexican place. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere was fitting and the food was amazing. I ordered the Barbacoa, pollo and roasted pork tacos and all three were tasty. One thing I did notice though was that if you order tacos you need to ask for lettuce, tomato, cheese etc. and they will give you a nice loaded taco. But if you choose to not get these extra items added on your taco may seem a bit dinky in size and portion. Overall I would confidently say their authentic food and famous tacos are worth the try if you're in the area. Neighborhood is a tad sketchy but the strip mall it's located in alleviates that.",

I like that the entrees come with rice, beans and gauc and most of the food is very tasty. The free chips could be better, but that's pretty much my only complaint about the food. Today we came with our toddler and ordered a plain cheese quesadilla for her. It was SO good that my husband and I couldn't stop eating it. It's such a simple, basic thing but somehow they cooked it very well. We had way more food than we could eat and it was only around $25, so definitely a good value. We will come back for sure.",

My wife enjoyed her fish and sweet potato fries.  My classic burger (bacon and cheese) was cooked just right and very flavorable.  I ordered fries as a side and they stayed crispy on the drive home.   \n\nThe food is on the higher end for pub fare, but honestly, its well worth it.  Our order totalled just under $30 and we got a lot of food for that!!!!!",

Overall, this is a college bar.  One that has mostly younger crowd.  That is not me.   Yelp doesn't have a rating for that.\n\nSo, don't believe in the websites they post.  If you want a noisy place to slip up to the bar and yell at each other, go for it.",

My friend had the plantain Chips, which were outrageously over priced and not very good. The mixed drinks are great and priced competitively. I had the chicken tenders, which were slightly over cooked but still good. In other words: come here for the drinks, but get dinner elsewhere. \n\nHowever, any good attributes were overlooked by a BAR that allows children. If a six to ten year old can sit at a bar and twenty something patrons who easily look like teens are not carded, this place is actively looking to (and 100000000% deserve) to get shut down. Children cannot sit at a bar. Period.",

      "text": "I was oscillating between 3 stars and 4 stars. I have been here twice so far, one time with a party eating/drinking out on the patio, another time with a friend inside the pub proper. The pub interior is nicely-decorated - it has a strange, old-timey, river/steam boat aesthetic to it. Not so nice was that the floor was very sticky, the tables were filthy, and the appetiser dishes were greasy, as if they were just blasted with water, no soap deployed. You don't have the same problem of goopy floor and tables outside, at l east, from the fact that the rain will at least clean it up. \n\nThe beers are decently priced for the area, and there is a fair selection. The main star of the show, though, is their pub food. It is definitely some of the most unique in Lafayette, with such fair as massive blocks of buffalo milk cheese, battered and deep fried (appropriately called cheese bricks), fried bits of alligator, ground lamb sliders, fried plaintains chips, and more. Most of what I tried so far is delicious - though I would not recommend the plaintain chips. They are inconsistently cut and so most of them will be soggy and chewy, instead of crispy or crunchy like you would expect with plaintain chips. They are served with an orange cream soda sauce, though, which is one of those weird things that somehow goes with everything. \n\nWhich brings me to another +/-, their creative sauces accompanying their appetisers. I am noticing a pattern of them matching good but whacky sauces with things that do not compliment them at all.  The gator bits are served with a ranch sauce that does not go with it at all. The cheese bricks are served with a raspberry sauce that is borderline too sweet for it. Then the orange cream soda sauce, which goes with everything, is only served with the nasty plaintain chips, which can't be salvaged even with the sauce. Really odd culinary choices, though not wholly unwelcome. They just need to recommend the orange cream soda sauce on everything. \n\nOne thing that helped bump the rating down was, from looking at other's reviews, I get the impression that they might have been gradually shrinking the size of appetisers over the years, but not reducing the price accordingly, though I could be mistaken. The cheese bricks today, for instance, are only served in a plate of four, though I am seeing that they originally came in an order of 6, ostensibly for about the same price as today, and then a bit later, 5. Down to 4, it seems we are. I am never alright with that sort of practice, if that appears to be what is happening. \n\nStill, I would say it is worth a visit now and then. Decent and unique selection of pub food, and it is great when the weather allows you to be out on the patio. I would just say mind the hygiene a little.",

Sound does tend to carry though; there were a few very loud patrons in when we were there, and it seemed quite noisy, but it was much quieter when they left. The patio looks like it's a great place to hang out when the weather is nice.\n\nThe bartender/server was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. \n\nWe would definitely come again!",

      "text": "We dropped in here for dinner on a Sunday evening when driving back to Chicago and we needed a dog friendly patio, as it was too hot to leave the dog in the car while we ate. The servers were friendly here. The downtown and this restaurant were dead on a Sunday night, but it still took a while to be helped. I think that's because the hostess was on a smoke break (sitting on some steps in the middle of the patio which was weird) and told us where to sit, but probably didn't tell our server. Only one beer was on draft, a good IPA, but was surprised that such a large bar and grill didn't have more draft selections. They have 3 sizes of burgers offered: 1/2 lb, 1 lb, and 1.5 lb, and they seem serious about those options. I would have liked to have seen someone go for the big one.\n\nAnyway, place was okay and it was dog friendly which was huge in our situation. Food was so-so but filling. I had the Reuben and my wife had the chicken tenders. I will say, portions were huge. The atmosphere was weird with only like 1 other table occupied in a large space. But maybe people just don't go out on Sunday nights in Lafayette. I could see this place being fun on a more crowded night. Looked like it might even have a stage, which could make for a livelier time.",

      "text": "This was not my first time at Digby's. I've been here multiple times before and usually I enjoy their food but I never got around to writing a review for them. Their cheese bricks are amazing and a must try for anyone that hasn't tried it yet - if you like cheese, that is. I've had issues with the service here before.This review is about a group event I planned at Digby's on a wednesday evening. \n\nTo give some context to this review, I was hosting an event for approximately 15 people. I called them two weeks in advance and made my reservation. When I called them the night prior to give them an updated headcount, I was told that there was no such reservation made. The person on the phone took down all the information once again and I updated the headcount to 14. She asked me to call them and let them know if there were any further updates before the start time. When I arrived at the scheduled time, I had one of the servers tell me that I did not make a single reservation. I asked her if she could check the system and she complained to me that I shouldn't expect them to have seating ready if I don't make a reservation. Since the first server was just accusatory, I went up to another server. I was helped by two other servers in setting up the tables and chairs, after my original reservation start time, on the deck/ stage area outside. They were both apologetic. One of them was off the clock at that point, but stayed on to explain what could have happened. He also mentioned to me that they have a new chef now and that they will be making some new additions/changes(daily fresh desserts for example) to the menu. He was very helpful. \n\nThe server assigned to our group was friendly and helpful, but it seemed like she was set up to fail from the get go. It was unlimited wings and half price bottle night, and there were 14 of us in the group. She was the only one assigned to the group. She tried her best to accommodate all of us and try to make it a good experience. Unfortunately, we had multiple instances of getting the wrong order and cold wings. The server was still a trooper and she was very apologetic for all of the chaos, but I believe that better planning on the management's part to handle a group this size would have alleviated a lot of the issues. Unless the place sorts out some of these issues, I would not recommend this place for groups. \n\nI had the wings themselves and I was not a fan. For each round of the unlimited wings, I tried a different sauce and in my opinion, the wings were just doused in the different wing sauces. I didn't have a single one that stood out as tasty. \n\nPrices are very decent. The unlimited wings on wednesdays are $9.99 and you also got half price bottles of wine. We got a Cab for $12.50 after the discount which was a good deal. \n\nDigby's has an amazing location. It is in the heart of downtown lafayette. They have a beautiful patio and on multiple occasions, they've brought it live music performers, during both the  summer and winter, which is great. There is seating inside as well. Even though it's a bit dimly lit, it gives a nice ambience. \n\nAll this said, I'd still probably go back for their cheese bricks. They assured me that it was going to stay on the new menu.",

While most of the business is take out, they do have a seating area for those who would like to eat in. Everything is freshly made and I have had no food that I was disappointed with. The menu is large and has a wide variety of food to choose from. I always get the egg drop soup, which is made daily and is always delicious. The crab rangoon and the egg rolls are great. The other appetizers are fantastic as well. There is a great selection of noodle dishes, seafood, even duck. I have been a customer here for decades and will continue to be for as long as I'm living in this town. Always happy with the service and the food. Top notch selection for West Lafayette when it comes to quality take out.",

Last night was the final straw. \n\nLast night I ordered Happy Family and it tasted like nothing and was loaded with onions. My wife ordered sesame chicken which was described as being served in a 'brown sauce'. What she got was General Tso with sesame seeds sprinkled on top. I tried hot and sour soup for the first time here and it was bland and somewhat gross. The 'pork' egg roll has no meat in it and tastes like the fryer oil is three months old. It was by far the worst meal we've gotten.\n\nI've ordered things occasionally for three years now. I keep the menu in a drawer and since there is no standardization among Chinese restaurants on anything other than General Tao/Tsao/Chao (but even its name isn't standardized!) I write down what I thought of each item I ordered. Let's go back in time and summarize everything on my menu to date:\n\nPork Egg Roll - \"More like Cabbage roll\"\nEgg Drop Soup - \"Bland\"\nGeneral Tso - \"ok, but sweet\"\nShrimp fried rice - \"good enough\"\nchicken lo mein - \"not great\"\nmoo shu chicken - \"really good\"\nmoo shoo pork - \"good\"\nfresh shrimp with lobster sauce - \"ok\"\n\nI forgot to rate some meals, but my God, how did I keep going here? Other than moo shoo they are clueless.\n\nThe place is a dump, the dining room seats about eight people, the people seem to resent being there, the prices are high. \n\nI would suggest going somewhere else, or just going nowhere.",

Entered the local at exactly 10:58 am because I needed to use the restroom and I was trying to order a milkshake in the meantime. Door wasn't locked. Nobody was in the ordering counter. There was a man (big man of color, middle age, bright green shirt, black cap) at the entrance looking at his phone as I entered and looked at me weirdly when I approached the counter. He didn't say anything. As I saw nobody there in the counter I went to the restrooms which were locked. Asked some employees that were there if I could order something, didn't know the place was open until 11:00. They told me this and I went back to the counter at exactly 11:00 am. There was a boy (young skinny, white, glasses, wavy blonde hair) there ready to take my order when a lady (middle age-big woman of color-short grayish hair-glasses, five guys uniform) started shouting at me saying: \"she came here when the place wasn't even opened and demanded someone to take her order\"  the boy taking my order started looking at me kind of embarrassed and started excusing her as I said to him \"sorry I wasn't demanding anything, I just needed to use the restroom as an emergency and that's why I didn't notice the time of opening\" she kept shouting at me repeating herself, didn't even bother to look at me when saying this, she was looking at the big man at the entrance. -they both looking very offended that I'm a foreigner and that I dared even to enter to a place with the door open, 2 minutes before 11 am, time of service.- I ended up not ordering anything, excusing myself to the boy and left the place pretty scared as the boy said there was no problem.\nTo the woman that shouted me out of the local: I wasn't being rude, I had an emergency. Hope you never find yourself in that situation. I was going to order something, I just needed to use the restroom while my order was ready, because I didn't want to use the restroom for free and I was never demanding. I barely even spoke and stayed quiet the whole time you shouted at me. But while I was looking for some compassion, you chose to deny me the use of the restroom and you lost a client.",

      "text": "Visited the Linnwood Tavern at about 0730 on a Saturday morning.\n\nSocial distancing was in effect and people had on masks when/where appropriate.\n\nOrdered the sausage omelet for breakfast and was thick and had an ample amount of cheese.  It was very tasty.  I have yet to order something off of the breakfast menu that was not superb.  Very good breakfast.\n\nSaturday mornings are fun there because at about 0900 the bar starts filling up with people that are continuing the party from the night before.  There is lots of music playing on the TouchTunes and darts being played at 0900 in the morning.\n\nLafayette is a factory town so there are many bars/taverns that open at 0700 to accommodate the third shift crew.  Linnwood Tavern is one of them and does a good job of accommodating the different crowds in the morning.  \n\nThe bar got remodeled and painted over the initial shutdown in the SPring and is very well done.\n\nIt is a smoking bar so that may affect your decision to visit.  The 'smoke eaters\" do a pretty decent job while you are there, but when you walk out you can tell you were in a smoking bar.  I am not a smoker, but it never has much of an affect on me.  \n\nThe Linnwood Tavern is a place for great breakfast and a good time, even at 0800 on a Saturday morning!!!",

      "text": "Lynnwood Tavern is a local neighborhood bar, nothing fancy. There is a small stage for bands to perform, and some space for patrons to dance. There are plenty of TVs lining the walls, as well as dart boards and a jukebox pumping out music. This is a smoking establishment, with clean ashtrays on every table. I haven't visited during the evening, yet, to partake in any other entertainment they provide, so this review is about the food.\n\nAnd the food is good. New ownership revamped the menu and cleaned the place up a bit. There are daily specials, and breakfast is served every day until 2 pm. The beef and noodles is awesome, just the right amount of food, at a very good price. Their pork tenderloin is mammoth, and the breading stays crunchy throughout the meal. The bun looks puny covering the huge slab of meat. \n\nI recently discovered Lynnwood's breakfast menu. Normally, I go right for the corned beef hash. But my wandering eyes fell upon this contraption called the stuffed hashbrown waffle: hashbrowns with diced green peppers and onions and your choice of breakfast meat, cooked on a waffle iron. It comes with two eggs, and toast/biscuit. It looks a little funky, but the crispy shell combined with the fresh peppers and onions make this an amazing dish. You only live once, so I ordered a side of sausage gravy to go with it.There was enough gravy to cover the huge biscuit AND the meal. \n\nI think I found my new breakfast favorite. \n\nLynnwood Tavern now does accept credit cards. The kitchen hours are limited: 7 am - 2 pm every day, and 5 pm - 8 pm M - W, 5 pm - 9 pm Th - Sat. I would have given Lynnwood Tavern five stars except for the blast of smoke smell when you enter, and lingers inside. If you are a smoker, you probably won't notice it. The staff is great and attentive; when it gets busy they can be taxed so be patient.",

With many Chinese food places closing down due to health code, this place has been around long and never had issue.\n\nTldr; the chef here knows how to work a wok and makes the best stir fry dishes in town.

      "text": "A one-star well-earned -- this is without a doubt the worst Asian restaurant I have ever eaten at in my life. I can excuse the tacky decour, the owner or other employee's kids talking and screaming loudly in the dining area, the dirty kitchen smell, and the sticky floor that clearly has not been cleaned beyond maybe once-overs with soapless water and a mop now and then. I can't excuse food that was literally inedible. I ordered the chicken yaki udon -- a simple classic that no one should be able to mess up -- and szeschuan chicken, which comes with a side of rice built in to the price. \n\nBoth came out relatively fast, and, at least for the szeschuan, it was apparent that in their haste, they forgot to properly cook the vegetables. Broccoli, bell peppers, carrot slices -- all of it was crunchy from being undercooked/close to raw. That would not have been too much of a problem -- I don't mind my veg -- if the dish had any flavour to the sauce or the chicken, but it didn't. For a dish that was marked as \"spicy\" on the menu, there was no heat at all, being served in a limpid, soy-like sauce with no flavour other than sodium, and the chicken was tough. I could not stomach more than a few mouthfuls of the yaki udon -- the whole dish smelled like dirt because of an overabundance of undercooked bean sprouts, with no taste besides that cloying stench. I now know why some people have an inordinate aversion to bean sprouts -- they must have eaten at places like O-ishi once in their life. \n\nIn short, for the ~$23 total, you get a cup of rice that smells like dishwater, and some bits and pieces of dry chicken, as those were the only items I could choke down. Do yourself a favour and stay clear of this place -- you will just waste your money for food that is worse than Panda Express.",

      "text": "For me, O-ishi is a series of hits and misses, and the opinions throughout the campus tend to be similar (love it or hate it). They have a number of things they do VERY WELL, and a couple of menu items that someone clearly just thought \"let's add this just because\", and then the chefs had to improvise from there. Overall though, my experience with O-ishi has been excellent and I've been coming here since freshmen year (meaning, before they took credit card and, frankly, when they were still working on wiring things up).\n\nIt's a real hole in the wall, mom and pop, diner-like place with an emphasis on comfort food that has a similar feel to the restaurant at the back of C&T Market. They're down at Rivermarket, and most of the time you can get there via 23/Connector or 1B. However, I don't know how it currently is with the construction going on and the bus routes shifting. Very casual, good for groups and family, and (won't lie) most of the people who go are some flavor of Asian. I've known people who were a bit intimidated by this, but don't be. The staff is very friendly, super casual, patient, and very attentive. Surprisingly, it's also a really good date night spot. \n\nTheir menu is a mish-mash of Japanese, Korean, the most basic of Indian dishes, and different flavors of Chinese food. Unlike Ichiban, the don't solely focus on Szechuan dishes, and there's definitely some dishes that have more a Beijing, Shanghai, or even Taiwanese taste. Actually, I have some trouble describing just how extensive this menu is. Few years ago, they had some really worn torn menus and you got multiple menus (some purely in Chinese) to show the regular dishes and the specials. Since then, they've tried to update. Two years ago, they finally got a card reader to take credit cards, put up more things on the wall, made it so their tables aren't sticky anymore, and streamlined their menus so you get the nicer ones you have today WITH English translation. So kudos for their effort.\n\nSo there is a range of spicy and then a range of non-spicy food. For example, the curry that comes with the roti appetizer is hot, but not the same kind of hot as any of the pepper dishes. The highlight for me though, is their hotpot. I've come here with groups of 4 to 6 just for their hotpot. They come with a range of sauces and just SO MUCH FOOD. Definitely recommend it, it's fun. It's probably also important to note that Ichiban really holds to the traditional Chinese way of dining, which is where you order multiple dishes to share. Everyone gets a bowl of rice and no dish is really one person's. I've known this to confuse some friends who would order something like beef and green beans and got really confused when what they got really was a giant pile of beef and green beans and just that with a bowl of rice. There's just a real emphasis on GROUP eating. And really, trying out new things on their extensive menu is a pretty fun. I recommend getting the Scallion/Green Onion Pancakes (they have it even if it's not on the men) to use to dip into any other dish you order as long as it has some kind of sauce. It's a bit pricey compared to some other places, but I find it worth it considering just how much food they give you (my inner college student purrs in contentment). \n\nBest way to order when you go in a group is to have at least one vegetable dish, two protein dish, something small like dumplings or roti, and a noodle or rice. If you want to be even more legit, afterwards, you squabble over who gets to pay for the check (by any means necessary, you will pay for it). XD \n\nOkay, okay, just joking. You order and pay however you want. Usually though, you go to where the cash register is to pay. Basically, that spot next to the low shelf where they keep the menus and take out boxes/bags. Oh, and before I forget, don't be afraid to just go up and grab whatever take out boxes and bags you need. It's just faster that way. \n\nIn summary, good service, usually really good comfort food (and a lot of it), on campus (convenient location if you don't mind crossing that nightmare intersection), and a nice and casual ambience. You should defnitely visit at least once, though I suggest going with a lot of people so you can try something of everything to see what you do and do not like. You'll find SOMETHING, as long as you're open to trying.",

Also - I hate when places add a tip to the bill for less than 6 people!  Then they included a \"tip suggestion\" as if it was not added.  REALLY WRONG especially since tipping is not mandatory.  I am a good tipper and hate when people do not tip right or at all just as much as when a place tries to scam you for extra tipping.  So VERY WRONG  Something overall lacking and I know there are better places out there, cleaner places and honestly just do not go.",

The noodle bowls are also strong. There are many other things worth eating, but if you haven't spent time in Asia they might not be up your alley.\n\nThe food is Malaysian-Chinese fusion, and is a little spicier than most Chinese cooking, although noodle bowls and rice dishes are innocuous enough for your less adventurous comrades.\n\nSmoothies and Boba tea are worth having.\n\nThis place is a foodie's paradise.

The specialty section is also written in English and has descriptions under names. My favorite is mapo-tofu  and cumin lamb. I think the got the best mapo tofu around this area. Double cooked pork is not the best Ive ever tasted, but way better than other Chinese food in this area. Yes, it will sometimes taste too spicy, salty and oily because of its origin where preservation of food is only achieved through over flavoring the food. \n\nThis restaurant deserves four stars. Service is not always perfect, their 'regular menu' does not taste good enough, and restaurant feels unorganized. Only reason I am giving five stars is the under-ratings at Yelp.",

We found out by accident when my boyfriend saw a dish another customer was eating that we wanted to try. The waitress showed us the item on the Chinese menu and since then, that is all he orders. We went in yesterday, and the waitress even went to the lengths to give us the paper menu because it was up to date and explained that the reason the dish we ordered isn't on that English menu is because it's rarely ordered but showed us one that was similar. \n\nNOTE: If you are curious to try, ask for a beef soup with pancakes. This is a light broth dish with vermicelli noodles, bok choy, earwood mushrooms, bamboo, and sliced beef with a side of scallion pancakes.\n\nO-ishi is a pricey place to eat though (they automatically charge a 10% tip to your bill) and sometimes the food can be a bit salty, which is why I give it 4 stars.

      "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to check this place out on a Sunday afternoon. It was quiet, there was only one other party of two there.  The decor is definitely outdated and it seemed as though this has been around for awhile.  \n\nThe waitress was friendly and welcoming.  We both ordered the steak and chicken hibachi with gyoza as an appetizer.  Our salads came first.  I chose the ginger sauce, while my bf chose the sesame one.  I liked his better, but I just wanted to try something different! Our gyozas came out next.  It was fresh and really hot! Once it cooled down, the flavor was great, and the sauce complimented it. \n\nNext, the chef came out with his cart.  He was very friendly and explained the different sauces that paired with the meats. Even though we ordered the chicken and steak, he added a couple pieces of shrimp, which we appreciated. The portion was very large and I really liked the sautéed vegetables! \n\nOverall, the food was great but it is a bit overpriced.  As someone stated in a previous review, you are paying for the show.  You can get a similar meal at a cheaper cost at a different Japanese restaurant.  It was a good early dinner date though for my boyfriend and I. Maybe with some renovations this place can get a little bit more business, because I can see it being a great spot for a date night.",

      "text": "I've lived in Lafayette my whole life (except for 6 years in the service) and had only been here once when I was a teenager. We were driving by to go somewhere else to eat and I joked about stopping at Mt. Fuji for dinner. So we tried it. The food was really good! I got the Steak Habachi and the spouse got the Fish Habachi. The only thing you need to be aware of is it is a Habachi restaurant. So you sit at a table with others. They aim to wait until a table is full and orders are taken before your chef comes out and cooks everyone's food. So if you come in hungry, expect this and order an appetizer. I'm deducting one star as the high chair they had was broken.\n\nDon't let the faded sign and outside appearance of the place deter you. It was clean and the staff was friendly. Recommended!!\n\n(Also I was very pleased to use the word 'Habachi' so many times in this review)",

We informed the cook, but he acted as if he could not smell what we were smelling. He finished cooking and attempted to serve them to us. I declined, but my sisters both trusted his word. They both regretted that decision. He told the manager to take them off our bill. She came to our table, and instead of recognizing the issue, she proceeded to tell us how she's never served a bad shrimp in her 21 years working here. I personally would not recommend this place to anyone.",

      "text": "I've gone here twice, and I won't lie, not their biggest fan. It's fun, it's just that teppanyaki isn't really for me. My brother. however, LOVES IT.\n\nThe important thing to remember is that you go there for the show. The chefs are performers and entertainers. You're there to have a good time, interact, see some fireworks, laugh with friends. In that, the chefs succeed. They're great and pretty funny as long as you're open to chat and interact. Be aware, because there are multiple stations, during busier hours when there's multiple tables going it can get a bit loud.\n\nFood has kind of a one note flavor and kind of salty for me. Actually, I would see most of it was pretty dry. Even the rice. However, I've also noticed that some of my friends who have kinda only ever eaten American Midwest cuisine seem to like it a good bit better than the rest of us.\n\nThe other problem for me is that I just had trouble getting to it. College student, no car, relies on bus and friends. And when I actually have to have a friend drive me somewhere or recommend a place, it just isn't here. \n\nHowever, the food is cheap and plentiful and can be pretty fun. If you go with a large group of friends and family, there's a good chance you'll have a good time. Best wishes!",

      "text": "I went there for a birthday celebration a couple nights ago and was very happy with the experience. the restaurant feels open - they have windows with light coming in unlike another hibachi place I went to nearby once upon a time. The service was good - waitress wasn't exactly jovial, but was quick and efficient. Our chef had a nice upbeat demeanor and wasn't too cutesie - sometimes those hibachi guys get annoying.\n\nWe started with the miso soup with salad. Soup was not bad, ginger salad dressing left something to be desired, but not saying it was bad, just have had better. \n\nThey dont seem to have a website, so I will not be using authentic food names here:\n\nAppetizers were a steak kebab in a sesame sauce. Fantastic. We also had the deep-fried tofu. The exterior was delicious as was the sauce, but I thought the tofu itself was too large. Would have been better to have more, smaller pieces to get a lower tofu/exterior ratio. Overall the appetizers were very good.\n\nOur main courses were filet/shrimp and a chicken/pasta number. It of course came with fried rice & vegetables. The rice was good. The vegetables were just ok. Shrimp and filet were outstanding as was the pasta. Never had a noodle dish quite like that and the noodles had a lot more flavor than I was expecting. Chicken was just ok. \n\nOverall, my rating also takes into account how bad the other hibachi place in town was the last time I went there a couple years ago. The two restaurants are not comparable. Mount Fuji is great - now they just need a website so people can look at their menu.",

This restaurant is definitely underrated and hidden under the undeserved popularity of the other local Japanese steakhouse Asahi. Besides a slight conversational language barrier the staff was extremely friendly. There were only a few customers in the restaurant when we went later on a Saturday evening. The cook was entertaining, skilled, very friendly to the young children at the table, and most importantly the food was very good. We had the shrimp, steak, and chicken. I would recommend all three. The cook made sure to drop a piece of each meat in their respective sauce dishes in front of you to be sure you used the appropriate sauce for each meat.\n\nWe will definitely be back to Mount Fuji in the future and we will be sure to bring more people with us to be sure Mount Fuji becomes a  popular Lafayette restaurant destination.",

      "text": "I spoke to my friend and the reason this place has 2 stars is because of the previous ownership involved. However, I'm from California and my friends brought me here for hot pot. I was so happy. There are so many options here, it's quite astonishing. All of it for just the simple price of $25. The waitress knew that I was from out of town, and kept asking to see if I enjoyed the food, and I got to say, I did. The meat felt good, the vegetables were just right, and the complimentary side dishes were amazing. It doesn't seem like too many people know what hot pot is out in Indiana, but man, it's like the best meal to have on a cold winter day. JUST GOOGLE WHAT IT IS!!! Like seriously. I know it's 2 stars, but I was so impressed. They also provide several different types of sauces so you can mix and match them to get the nice flavorful meal you always desired.\n\nPLEASE, MANAGEMENT HAS CHANGED AND YOU WILL BE DELIGHTFULLY PLEASED WITH THE SERVICE AND THE AMOUNT OF FOOD YOU GET(HOT POT).",

The place seemed tidy enough and yet a little rough around the edges. \n\nI really wanted pork buns or a similar style dumpling but they said it would be 25 minutes or so.  I didn't have that much time so i just ordered beef with garlic sauce from their lunch menu. \n\nThe beef didn't look or taste like beef to me.  It was very lightly colored.  I'm guessing it was actually slices of pork. That aside the dish was ok and not much different from other similar Chinese restaurants.",

Both menus are written in English. My Szechuan fish strips arrived quickly and they were tasty and spicy. \n\nOn the negative side, we ordered 2 entrées (Szechuan fish strips and Moo Shu Chicken) and one milk tea and our bill was almost $33. We ordered at the counter and the guy who took our order acted as if he were doing us a favor. He was like a parody of hostile wait staff you would see on Saturday Night Live. When they brought the food to our table, the woman refilled my husband's water and that was the extent of the service. The decor was okay but the TV was blasting some Chinese movie which made conversation difficult. \n\nThis place would probably be okay for takeout or if you like watching Chinese movies.",

Ordered 3 dishes and an appetizer (chicken lo-mein, 2 Gen.Tso's and crab rangoon) $34.00. Everyone took 1-2 bites and we got up and left it all...grossest chinese food ever. Oil dripping out of the sugary sweet crab rangoon. The Gen Tsos tasted like ketchup. so sick. No argument -no bs, we all just got up and left. The lady chased us out the door and said \"what wong?\" My Husband politely told her we did not like it and she said \"we been here 14 years - you first to complain food is no good.\"  I highly doubt that.

There are flat-screens throughout the sports-themed pub with a separate pub/bar area (with full bar) that is 21+.\n\nA great place for residents to take friends and family. A great, very close place for residents of Bar Barry Heights and University Farms to enjoy as well.\n\nDon't be fooled by the location within Westminster. This is a great place to enjoy a meal.",

I've had many amazing rolls in my mouth which have delighted my tongue and my senses. Nothing has quite given me the pleasure nor the sensory delight that this wonderful sushi has given me. From the moment I opened the container to the time I swallowed the last fleeting bite, I could not hold back the joy swelling within my heart. I smiled ear to ear as I finished this delicacy. Quite possibly the best sushi in the United States. I do not say this lightly. Trust in me, a past doubter and enemy of sushi restaurants, now turned sushi lover. This has truly changed the way I view sushi. I will continue to strive for the joy this sushi brought me today. I cannot convey through any number of words or phrases how truly amazing and special this sushi was. To anyone looking for sushi, look no further, I promise on my life that this will more than satisfy the hungry sushi monster that thrives within us all. I love Majé Sushi and will continue to do such until I pass on from this world. Do not miss your chance. Life is short, have Majé Sushi. -Thomas, the most critical food critic.",

Brown rice (sometimes) available for extra charge.

Mostly just salmon, tuna, eel, yellowtail, Krab, and shrimp (cooked or tempura); do have inari and a real crab roll. Does not have salmon skin, mackerel, roe, egg, squid, white fish, etc. etc. etc. But the quality is much higher than a store and you can call to order ahead.\n\nA much wider range is available at the sushi/Japanese restaurant around the corner, but Maje is open later and does basic take out quickly and well.",

I spent $17 on the Orange Dragon roll plus 3 pieces of salmon sashimi. While the sushi roll was actually somewhat bearable and packed well enough, the sashimi was super cheap and not even cut into a proper shape. The three pieces were awful, almost frozen, and barely looked like salmon. I have heard some good reviews from friends about this place so I was surprised by how utterly disappointing everything was.

      "text": "Oh, Maje.  How I love you.  You were the first place I ever tried sushi and you were the place I went back to week after week after week after week during my time at Purdue.\n\nMaje is delicious.  The prices have gone up a little since I first started going there (2 years ago) but they're still completely reasonable.  A California roll is $4.  A lot of the rolls are customizable, so you get to pick the kind of fish you want.  I also had a roll asked to be made without the cream cheese and it came out perfectly.  You really can't go wrong.\n\nI highly recommend any of the Dragon Rolls.  I also highly recommend calling ahead to order to avoid a wait when you get there.  The space isn't very big and can get crowded with raw salmon lovers quite quickly.\n\nI definitely prefer them to Maru.  I'm can't wait until the next time I'm on campus so I can get my sushi fix and relive my glory days at old Purdue!  Boiler up!",

I tried the Anywhere But Here and Forbidden Donut. My dad loves the chai! The passion fruit did a curious jungle thing with the coffee, not for everyone but it does work! Sadly the Forbidden Donut with all its anticipation of mixing two wonderful worlds wasn't so great. Tasted like mushy old donut instead of that fresh baked morning drugs infused with caffeine beans - looks like there's a few left I got to try so I'll have to come back. Great deal to see making good use of the Joe's app! Every coffee shop should use Joe!",

Prices are a tad high as with sushi in the midwest. A good sized appetite will need near thirty dollars to fill up which isn't uncommon like Maru and Make but Sake has everyone beat with their huge menu. I noticed a little discount on the Yelp app for checking in and ordered that udon. It was fantastic! Tried the crab rangoon too, in house batter for the win. My buddies got sushi which was as good as the Boilermaker city can get. I'm not sure why they don't make their own Thai tea but the canned stuff wasn't awful. Parking isn't an issue for dinner with most streets being open this side of downtown. Lots of great places around like Revolution BBQ, Town & Gown, and RedSeven, and glad to find out this good option for Asian cuisine.",

Especially with the tables upstairs!\n\nAfter looking through the menu, we decided sushi was going to be our main focus even though the other items on the menu looked good! We'll have to come back for those ;)\n\nWe went with 5 rolls total: shrimp tempura, yummy, tiffany roll, american dream, and lafayette. The first three were maki rolls and the last two were the house special rolls. The house special rolls were definitely our favorite! I feel as though the maki rolls were kinda thin, but I understand it was because of the different price point. \n\nThe server was very nice, although she didn't refill our waters at all, even when I had asked at the end of our meal. We paid and decided to just leave lol. \n\nI definitely recommend this restaurant and I'd return!",

I am from California so I was happy to discover that it is possible to find decent tasting sushi in the Midwest. The atmosphere inside is nice and the place is quiet. But there is a sulfuric smell of mildew or something unpleasant that is unappetizing and makes me not want to go back. If the smell were resolved I would give this place a higher rating for sure!",

It was the day after July 4th and there didn't seem to be a lot of people out and about the town. The other spot we wanted to try seemed to have closed down permanently so we found this on Yelp. Although it sounds like an exclusively sushi place, they actually have a very extensive Chinese menu. Turns out when we arrived that the sushi chef was not in so only kitchen items would be served.\n\nWe decided to order their Sichuan special. You can pick from a list of meat, mushrooms, veggies, etc. and they will stir fry/satay it with the spicy sauce. It is absolutely delicious! We got various other items off the menu and everything tasted great, we were very impressed :)",

Most of us got sesame chicken and it was pretty big so I would recommend sizing down to lunch size. The sesame chicken was drowning in sauce and there wasn't much clean space to get rid of the excess or where to put rice without getting it soggy. We were the only people in the restaurant, but the service was a bit slow and non intuitive, we had to call for our waitress several time but it wasn't a big problem since it wasn't crowded.\nOverall it is a good spot for an Asian fusion, but you have to leave some time for the servers to wake up.",

The microwave is in sight of the dining room and I watched my hot sake and steamed edamame both come out of that microwave and brought to my table. I get that restaurants use microwaves, I just would rather not watch it. \n\nThe server took a while to bring water and then confessed she was waiting for the water glasses to be washed. How they didn't have clean water glasses was truly puzzling because the restaurant was not busy. \n\nWhile I ate, the staff never came to clean up the dirty tables, so I was surrounded by tables with empty plates and used napkins, it was less than appetizing. \n\nThe 2 sushi rolls were good! I was pleasantly surprised by the food, but the experience was impacted by the service. If they could hire staff that knows how to run a dining room, I would return.",

When we visited (10/11/20), they didn't have any soft drinks available, just water and tea (sweetened and unsweetened); this wasn't an issue for us, but I know it could be for some people (I think their machine was down, because they do normally have them). They also won't have alcohol until 10/14, if that's an issue for you.\n\nThe space is bright and welcoming, with plenty of seating (both booths and tables). The banquettes seem to be custom made, and there are beautiful masks and mosaics decorating the walls. I never would have imagined that this space had once been an Italian restaurant! There is outdoor seating, but it didn't seem to be in use even though the weather was gorgeous.\n\nService was polite, though food was brought out as it was finished, instead of all together. I was a little taken aback when the waiter started trying to take my plate as he asked if I was finished (I wanted a box, because portions are MASSIVE).\n\nPayment was done by scanning a QR code, which was convenient, though it wasn't working for us. They do have a handheld card reader they can bring around.\n\nThe food itself was every bit as delicious as I remember the Riviera Maya in downtown Anderson being. You get a lot for what you pay.\n\nNOTE: There IS a kids' menu, but it's not in the printed menu. Just ask you server!",

      "text": "This was our first time visiting Riviera Maya and the three stars is not necessarily for anything bad, but rather for just being average. The service was fine and the seating was in accordance to new health department guidelines.\n\nThe decor is straight out of the \"Mexican restaurant in a box\" catalog. If you have been to Lindo Mexico or El Rodeo or.......you have seen this interior. \n\n I ordered a chicken quesadilla and accidentally got it with the shredded chicken. That means it came with all of the peppers and onions in it. That is my fault. The refried beans were good, and the chips that you get for free we're good as well. The salsa was nothing spectacular. Our Margaritas were average normal Mexican restaurant margaritas.\n\nIf you are on the east side of Lafayette and do not want to travel to El Mason, Lindo Mexico, or some of the other restaurants in town, then your Mexican fix will be fulfilled by going here. \n\nAgain, nothing bad, just generally average. Next time, we will make the trip to El Mason.",

      "text": "Margaritas Suck!!! \n\nI'll start by sayin despite their mistakes this is still great food. Not amazing, not best ever but from this Texas palate is good and better than all others in Lafayette. \n\n3.4 is the overall after 2 visits. \n\nBoth times the first being dinner and second lunch we ordered the same meal. Other that the pitcher of margaritas. \"They were horrible\", that's all I can say about drinks other than  typical cloudy tea.\n\nI've had the Chimichanga Acapulco and a al a carte tamale both times and the only complaint is you will discover no more than 3 whole shrimp and it will not be evenly distributed in the chimichanga, however it is flavorful. The tamale with queso is always good.1/2 the dish had no shrimp!!! The inconsistency cost them 1 point. Along with crappy pitcher of margaritas. Those should draw people but they missed on the margaritas big time. I will try a specialty margarita when I return for dinner and give them a shot at redemption. \n\nJ's second try at Arroz Con Pollo, was as good as the first but Tortillas were served the second try which seems appropriate but not the first visit. The restaurant preps all chicken in tiny strips and it's not a traditional Arros Con Pollo but very good according to J.",

      "text": "This place is where the old Spaghetti's used to be located. The food here kind of reminds me a bit of Chi Chi's.... if you are old enough to get that reference. It's a very Americanized TexMex restaurant that serves a lot of food on your plate. For the everyday Joe, this place is fine. If you are expecting anything close to authentic, this isn't it. In fact we started laughing when the waitress asked us what a Poblano was when I had asked her if any of the dishes contained them. I then asked what dishes they had that were spicy on the menu, and she didn't know and 2 other waiters came over when she asked, and they all kind of laughed. Yeah, then we laughed too because here we are at a Mexican restaurant and there's nothing spicy on the menu. Lol ! I got a horchata to drink. It was fairly tasteless. I also got a margarita and that was weak. Dang it, I really needed a drink. *sigh* The chips and salsa were probably the highlight of the meal. The salsa tasted really fresh. The chips looked and tasted made in-house and were light and crispy. My friend got a chimichanga and seemed to like it. I got the shrimp al diablo. The ONLY somewhat spicy item on the entire menu. They did have a salsa they brought out that you could add that was brown and spicy, but I didn't really like it. It kind of tasted like burnt dirt. Haha. They gave me salsa verde and that was fine. This is what I ended up using on my shrimp. Corn tortillas are available, so that's good. Most people get the flour tortillas, but corn is a bit more traditional. The Diablo (devil in Spanish) was missing heat... it had a little; but, well, I did say this was Americanized afterall. The Devil apparently lives in a condo on the lake lol !!! Each dinner was served with lots of rice and beans. So, I gave it 4 stars because it's a lot of food and it's decent. Many people will probably like it. I prefer more flavor, but this is probably fine for most folks.",

It only had chicken and potatoes in it. the chicken was very dry and the potato tasted like a hash brown (crispy on the outside soft on the inside). I think that they pan fried the chicken and potatoes then put it in the curry, hence the dry chicken and crispy potato. The curry was a little oily and bland. I also ordered a side of sausage which was pretty decent. Tasted like the Chinese sausage my mom would get from the grocery store. It was sliced and cooked well!\n\nI really tried to give this place a second chance but eh not a fan! My boyfriends pho wasn't oily this time though!",

      "text": "If I could take a star away and rate this a zero I would.\n\nI can't blame the second visit on my wife. I wanted PHÓ so I decided since I didn't actually eat the last time I was here I would order what they have and give a complete review. For starters RUDE waiter/server, yes one in the same. Let's just call this dude the beatnik. He took our drink orders by saying can I get you guys waters? We both said yes but I ordered a Thai Tea as well. As he dropped my TT off my wife attempted to get his attention but was ignored. He returned with our waters and my wife stated she was trying to get his attention to order something else and his response was \"ok so tell me\". Just seemed off putting. We ordered the pork dumplings and I ordered the Green Leaf Special PHÓ, my wife ordered the flank and round PHÓ. The drinks were delivered and the raspberry tea my wife ordered was like juice not tea, the Thai Tea was package product not made from scratch. The dumplings which I expected to maybe be pan seared but steamed, these were fried hard all the way around, 2 out of 5 and don't attempt with chop sticks. While eating apps we surveyed the dining room. Walls by our table were disgusting. The ceiling had water stains and there was clutter on tables close to the register. There was also a sliding glass door fridge in the dining room which a cook came and retrieved items from items from multiple times. \n\nFood arrived and the broth was more akin to water than broth, I have seriously had better from a box. First observation of mine was lacking. My PHÓ the house special all the meat, flank, round, tripe, meat ball, chicken and shrimp. There was no flank, two shrimp, 3 slivers of shredded chicken and two meat ball quarters. It all seemed bland, no color on the meat and just no flavor. I added the cilantro, basil, jalapeño and bean chutes. Another taste called for salt, pepper and a heavy dose of sriracha. Both my wife and I ordered a large but my bowl was twice the size and not for meat sake, crowds of noodles. I would never ever ever order this PHÓ or any other from GL again, it's a waste of $38.00 w/tip. \n\nLeave this place to the college crowd and hopefully they will go out of business.",

      "text": "Predictable yet restrained, great spot for quality and tasty Vietnamese inspired cuisine on a simple menu of appetizers, soups, and dishes with most a noodle or rice base. There's a few great dishes but majority isn't that appealing for me. I'd prefer more hits of heat and flavor like the lemongrass chicken - that's my jam! Good service, polite staff, place felt clean and open, and menu is good for wheat and other allergies. Our food arrived fast and fresh. My curry was perfect both flavor filled. Will definitely come back!.... \nUpdate: Was just back four months after the above (took way too long). Tried the Rice and Yellow Curry Tofu, friend had rice, egg, and sausage. All super! Teas are super tasty but overpriced for tea flavored sugar water.",

      "text": "Green leaf was pretty good but they made two fatal mistakes in my to-go order. One was that the spring rolls didn't taste fresh. I suspect that they placed the rolls on top of my hot food which gave them a texture and taste that made me toss them in the trash. The second mistake is that my boba coconut drink was served lukewarm. I don't know about you but I always see ice in my boba drink. No ice here. Just straight up liquid. Instead of a nice refreshment. It made for awkward temperature and taste. Everything else was delicious.",

I ordered carry out and only had to wait about 15 min.\n\nI was craving Pho but was disappointed in the lack of flavor. It wasn't bad but the broth and meat didn't have much flavor. Once I added some sauce it was good but I preferred to not have to put anything in my pho. I did get it to go so that might have been why. The portion size was good and they did a great job of separating everything for me to be able to travel.\n\nWe also got two rice dishes one was pork it was good but I wouldn't order it again. \n\nThe star of the show was the rice with beef cube. The meat was cooked perfectly extremity flavorful and all the side items were very fresh. \n\nThe atmosphere was very nice with a mix of students, families and patrons of all ages.\n\nI would eat here again but wouldn't for pho.",

      "text": "I absolutely love Green Leaf! I'm still shocked at all the negative reviews though.\n\nTo a college student, Green Leaf is ideal. It's inexpensive, and the food is tasty and flavorful. Green Leaf's pho is the best hands down. It's filling, the broth is rich and has great portions. I have never been disappointed in the quality of food. Green Leaf also has a variety of bubble tea at a reasonable price, and generous portions as well. I even took out of state students to Green Leaf and they all agreed that the pho was one of the best.\n\nThe only downside to Green Leaf is the service, which is understandable because it is so popular. I would definitely avoid going on a Sunday night, as dining courts are closed and many students venture down to Green Leaf. The service is decent, however I always feel rushed because they are always trying to serve the huge crowds they come. If it does get too busy, such as the weekend for dinner, you may not be served for another 30 minutes.\n\nBesides service, I would definitely recommend Green Leaf! Especially if you're just visiting West Lafayette, as it is one of the better restaurants for Pho or Vietnamese food! :)",

      "text": "It's a good hole-in-the-wall place to casually meet up with good friends. \n\nThe place itself is kind of hidden away and not quite in view. If you know where Pint is at RiverMarket Apartments (the bar across the street from McDonald's and Triple X), just continue down the walk along the building, pass Kibu Cafe and the hookah place, and it's the last restaurant. \n\nSuper casual, and you might have to pull chairs and tables around because of the crowds during the busy hours. During those dinner rushes/lunch times, service may be a bit slow.\n\nFood is decent. Lots of options and things you can adjust. I'm not as much of a man, because a lot of the things have the exact same flavor profile. It doesn't take long for different appetizers to taste the same as your entree, depending on what you order (ex. spring rolls then pho). Which, honestly, not surprising. That's just how it is. I'm just not a big fan of it. But the food is good and filling, and it's a great place to go with friends. Bubble tea and boba are the same as any other place. Let's face it, pretty much everyone in the area uses the same powder for taro milk tea. Finally, I suggest going for the pho rather than the rice plates. I find a lot of the grilled meat options here rather dry and/or one-note.\n\nGo up to the cashier to pay. Be aware that this place is usually almost always just filled exclusively by college students. Unsurprisingly. It's also quite popular as a hangout and gets crowded really quickly. Even those hours you think are peaceful can suddenly get extremely busy and loud, so I don't suggest working on things here.",

The fact that this Vietnamese restaurant didn't have it was a small disappointment but I was willing to let that pass, if their pho was great. What disappointed me more was when out server told me that I could add sriracha to the pho and it tastes just like its spicy cousin. Not true. I was not impressed by the pho either. The side veggies were not even washed I felt like. The pho was lacking in flavor and did not bring any joy, like Vietnamese food usually does. \n\nThe place was packed, so maybe it could have just been the food that I got which was subpar. Or maybe, folks didn't have a better option anywhere nearby. Whatever the reason, I don't think the pho will ever draw me back. Prices were reasonable, especially for a college campus. Very disappointed with the service. They were barely there, didn't respond to requests for water. Had to put in multiple requests. I also didn't like how our server shouted out to us from across the room to come to a table.",

I definitely recommend adding the veggies to the soup for a nice variety of flavors. If I want to mix it up, I'll order the rice noodles with egg rolls and pork skewers or the yellow chicken curry. I also love the pork and shrimp spring rolls! They're light and refreshing. The service is always great, all of the servers are very kind and polite. I have noticed that if I go at peak dinner hours (5-7), it tends to take a little longer for the food to come out. This makes sense because they seem a bit understaffed, but regardless I always enjoy my food when it arrives! I would recommend going for lunch or at times when it's less busy for the best dining experience.",

The pho was super tasty, savory broth, and they had several options to pick from.  They also had a pretty big menu selection of other items, if you aren't interested in pho.\n\nWe ordered our little one the pork dumplings.

      "text": "Nothing fancy about this local bar on Main Street.  I walked right by it once before backtracking.  Just know that it is located under the marquee.  Once you enter, the bar is to the left and the dining area is to the right.  It's one of those \"seat yourself\" establishments.\n\nI didn't see anyone working on the dining side, so I asked for a menu at the bar and grabbed a seat at a table on the dining side.  Fortunately, a waitress arrived before long and I was able to place my order.  \n\nI will say that the Chicago Dog (with chips and pickle spear) was really good.  One of the best I've had.  It was fully loaded with that crazy blue/green relish, the pickled peppers, tomato slices and served on a soft bun with poppy seeds on it.  The dog itself was puffed and tasty.  In fact, the sandwich was so loaded that I had to eat from angles to avoid spilling the contents.  Very tasty indeed!\n\nI got the house chips which were crisp but could use a bit of salt/seasoning.\n\nFree street parking is available out front for up to 3 hours.\n\nOverall, quick and inexpensive food.  They have a 3-way bar set up, but I didn't try anything during my visit.\n\nReview #3341",

DT Kirby's is a perfect random mix of a dive bar and a restaurant. The clientele is a bit on the younger side (mid 20's) so you will have a very lively experience. Our server, Lelenne (sp?), was pretty great and on top of things. We took her advice and had the wasabi chicken wings, which were AMAZING!!!",

      "text": "We were seated immediately, but it took awhile for our server to come to our table. We ordered our drinks as I waited for my brother to arrive. There were five of us in a booth made for four. My brother refused to pull up a chair... So weird. He just squeezed in the booth side of the table. We ordered an app of fried mushrooms. I don't really like mushrooms, and I especially don't like canned mushrooms. The mushrooms they use for their fried mushrooms looked like sliced canned mushrooms. I was imagining the whole mushroom with the stalk removed. \nWe ordered our meals. Most of it came out right. My burger was a medium rare. I wasn't aware that all burgers came medium rare unless specified, which was fine. My bff's mom's meal was the only one they messed up. It came with fried mushrooms instead of the onion rings. The server explained her mistake when she brought out the meal, and we ended up getting the onion rings by the time we were getting ready to leave, so she bagged them up for us. \nI wasn't very impressed with the food or the server. The server just seemed sort of lost the entire time. The other guests with me had previously been the DT Kirby and said that some things had changed. They said the burger buns were different; they were larger and poorer quality. They also said the fries weren't the same. I didn't have any fries but they looked soggy and limp. But hey, the bathroom doors are cool.",

They have an extensive menu full of tasty-looking options. As an Indiana native, I am quite appreciative of their massive breaded pork tenderloin sandwich. I've tried both the cheese curds and fried pickles as appetizers and they're both very good. They have great deals on beer as well, with cheap domestic buckets even on the weekends. It's a Chicago-themed bar full of Chicago sports memorabilia. I'm excited to come here in the fall to watch a Bears game!",

      "text": "Hard to find a more authentic dive bar with Chicago menu and as much personality as DT Kirby's. The wait staff and bar keeps are edgy and cool, even more so than me in the 1980s. The menu is filled with voluminous options, and dozens of TVs keep the faithful entertained. As a bonus, sometimes Don will mill around the place and give patrons a warm welcome. The beer and liquor selection is good, big menu with many comfort favorites. The only thing keeping this 4.5 star review from 5.0 is the questionable bathroom cleanliness. Sometimes the smell is strong enough to knock a dog off the gut wagon, or at least make me hold my breath. Thank you Kirby's for always delivering a dive bar experience and locals' favorite hangout!",

      "text": "I had to check out this Chicago sports bar since I'm originally from the Chicagoland area. I had read that this place was hard to find since there isn't a sign on the outside so I relied on good ol google maps to lead the way! \n\nSince it's located in downtown Lafayette, expect to park on the street. Hope you're good at parallel parking unlike the person in front of me LOL \n\nThe inside is pretty cool. You can choose to sit at the bar or at a table. We opted for a table in the back. The decor has a Chicago homey feel to it which I was vibin' minus the Cubs stuff since I'm a White Sox fan! Boooo Cubs boooo!\n\nAh now for the food. I went with Trish's pita with fries instead of chips and my boyfriend ordered the Chicago Italian beef also with fries and had asked for it to be done Chicago style, meaning the bread/sandwich is dipped in the au jus and topped off with gardinera. When the food arrived it was fresh to order! No cold fries YAY! However my boyfriends Italian beef was not dipped and the au jus and peppers were on the side but we were hungry so he said it was fine. I had some of his sandwich and the beef was dry but the gardinera and bread was okay. Mmmm I've def had better in Chicago and this did not represent our city well! My pita wasn't too bad honestly! No complaints there. The chicken was seasoned well and tzatziki sauce on top was a good touch! We loved the fries!! They were cut wide but thin? If that makes sense! And they were crispy!! \n\nVerdict: average bar food with huge portions. Would I come back? Probably not. There isn't anything else on the menu that I would like to try. Too heavy for my taste but if that's your forte this is the place for you!",

The inside is sporty and bar-like with the bathrooms being disguised as porta poties. It was packed, but my party of 6 was still able to be seated right away.\n\n I had heard that DT Kirbys had a food challenge, and so I decided to give it a go. I got the Chicago dog with chips, prime burger with fried mushrooms, Brady brunch (sandwhich special for the Superbowl) with onion rings, and an appetizer of spinach & artichoke dip with fried pita bread chips. Every single item was spectacular. The burger was beautifully cooked, the sandwhich had some of the best chopped steak, and the sides were fried to perfection. With that being said, the challenge was tough. This place serves food to drunk people, so obviously its going to be greasy. I was able to complete the challenge in 40 minutes (45 time limit) and get the free meal, tshirt, and wall of fame. I do not think that most people can eat this much food, but if you're into challenges, give it a try.\n\nThe only negative was the fact that the server wasn't very knowledgeable about the specials, menu, or the challenge, which gave some of my peers triuble when ordering/paying as well as me trying to understand the challenge rules.",

We ordered quite a bit of food for carry out which included 3 different burgers. All the food except the burgers was great. All 3 burgers had a funny taste, not sure if it's a new seasoning (this isn't the first time we've got burgers here), new meat supplier, or maybe meat is just rancid. I can deal with something changing or something beyond the control of the restaurant that makes these things taste like well water. What I don't appreciate at all is the customer service, or lack thereof. Upon calling, I was told the manager couldn't be found (place was half full due to pandemic). Person I spoke with on phone said she talked to kitchen and nothing has changed. And then some MENSA associate in the background exclaimed \"to be honest, getting our food carry-out isn't the greatest.\" To be clear this is at least the third time we've ordered carry out from here during pandemic. And we've always had at least one person order a burger, and food has been fine. Sure, you lose a little bit in the transportation, but that drive home didn't make all 3 burgers taste like the Wabash River. Apparently, DT's has no interest in making this right and that is unfortunate as 3 of our family's main entrees are inedible, and we are out $30+ (burgers alone, at least we got some sides that will do the trick). So, I guess we just made our last trip to DT Kirby's. Kinda makes me sad...",

It has a great vibe, and the burgers were as promised very messy but delicious. They're also good sized burgers - I couldn't finish mine.\nI really enjoyed their fries which are different to your usual french fries (a little on the salty end). \nMy only issue would be with our waitress - she wasn't outright rude, but not exactly the friendliest/most approachable either. \n\nIt's definitely worth a visit.",

      "text": "We made late decision to eat postgame meal together, have a few Daddy Pops and watch football after great day in Ross Ade... I got parking spot at front door!  That was highlight of our meal... 30 minutes after sitting we got water and drink order in. The sense of urgency doesn't exist,,, granted people are running around, but it wasn't standing room only.. just busy. 8/10 busy. Our hostess was apparently busy doing something else. Like filling ketchup cups, as we witnessed the party across from us finish their meals before they got ketchup. Knowing this delay was standard, i noted the ketchup cups on a fridge and decided to fill my own for our table. I also got flatware, since having an enormous hamburger is generally a messy endeavor. Our food came out, 1.25 hours from walking in. Burgers were done right, except one... which was apparently due to fact that when trying to order a DT Kirby burger without mushrooms was delicately denied, so the hamburger became a Swiss Mushroom burger, for person not wanting mushrooms.  Remember we wanted to have a few beers. I got one... one beer due to lack of service.   Floor manager is really negligent, so unless he's the owner... he really needs a vacation, b/c he is not attentive to clients. \n\nWell my Bar Burger was good tasting, but cold. After more than an hour ... I could have eaten my arm. Which would have been crispy'er than the home chips. These were cooked in a fryer that was overwhelmed or under temperature. They were soaked in grease and about like eating leather coaster after soaking sweat from beer you wish could ordered earlier. \n\nWe won't return, no matter how clever this Chi-town motif is. I guess the Billy Goat tavern has no worry of competition or anything on lower Wacker drive...",

We all got pizzas and found them all well done and very tasty. There was nice indoor seating and fun to see outdoor options too but we took it all to go. I had the Mama's Little go and added a few additional toppings alonelg with trying the cauliflower crust, was super good! Tasted like a real pizza more than looking like a salad!

      "text": "I was looking forward to trying the pizza here because we have heard good things, but were disappointed with our experience at Azzip. My husband grew up in NJ/NY and has had some great slices, and I make pizza at  home (dough from scratch) on a semi-regular basis. \n\nThey get a 5 for customer service- they were happy to honor a kids' meal coupon even without our 2 year old being present (b/c COVID-19). We ordered two pizzas and ended up with 3 because of a mistake, which was generous of them. \n\nUnfortunately, 2 of the 3 pizzas were still incorrect- they added the right extra vegetables to what was the mistake pizza, but then added pineapple (not on the our list) to the pizza that was almost right. \n\nThey omitted 2 sides of Parmesan as well as 1 side of Grippos..my husband forgot to check the order before he left, but he also mentioned that there were very few (if any) customers eating in, so we aren't sure why there were so many mistakes and omissions.  \n\nThe pizza crust is thin and crispy, but to us tastes more like a yeasted version of a saltine cracker. They are generous with toppings, but some of the crust near the center was gooey and underbaked- like someone forgot to add time to account for more toppings. If they had people in training, it would have been better to have someone oversee or double check their work. \n\nWe really like the concept and the variety of toppings, but felt like the execution and dough could be much improved. We won't be back unless someone pays us to eat, and even then, we may hesitate..",

Pizzas are hand crafted in front of you and you get to choose whichever toppings you desire. Many menu options to choose from or make your own to your own liking. There are several seasonal options that are delicious, my favorite being the crab madness pizza available around March. The staff is incredible, both attentive and welcoming. The prices are inexpensive and the quality is unmatched, making this one of the best value restaurants in town.

I told the gentleman serving me that my order was gluten free and he asked if it was an allergy, I confirmed, and he took the time to clean off the counter, wash his hands, the utensils, and the whole space. I then proceeded to order a certain pizza and he caught that all of the ingredients in this specific pizza werent gluten free. I was very grateful that he warned me. I switched my order to a different type of pizza and he was extra careful with my order. It was a bbq type of pizza and it was AMAZING!!! The toppings were different that I have seen before and they all came together perfectly. It was also the perfect individual size for lunch. I was very satisfied with the entire experience! Definitely go get food at Azzip!",

The choices of ingredients are top notch, with roasted garlic and sun-dried tomatoes included among the more standard fare. They do a good job with gluten free pizzas, with a couple of options (including cauliflower-based crusts).\n\nThe staff have always been friendly, informative and patient.

I'm impressed with the plethora of options, great staff, sauces galore, and high quality Parmesan cheese to sprinkle. The zip sticks were good and the Funky Chicken was top notch tasty! The Chicken on the Beach was a disappointment, interesting concept but the queso cheese loaded down the middle of the pizza and it didn't cook through and through. Also, it's Pepsi, no Coke. Very decent beer options for $3 and $4 each.",

There has been a lot of excitement about this opening.\n\nI ordered a small employee creation called The Founder. You watch the employees make your pizza, much like at a sandwich shop. The oven is right there with them, and the finished pizza comes out by the cashier. Although I am not a huge fan of conveyor ovens, Azzip's pizza crust comes out nice and crispy, and stays that way.\n\nThe employees are friendly and don't rush you during your meal. The only downside is they serve only Pepsi products. Yes, they serve beer! \n\nDon't forget to get a couple warm cookies on your way out.",

I've dined here for breakfast many many times over three years and avoided leaving a review to keep traffic down. If we have had to wait it was less than 5 minutes. \n\nI will admit over three years they have improved on a couple staples. Not burning toast! THATS HUGE. My omelette despite the fillings is always served perfectly. For me that's not overcooked and slightly medium inside. Just tell them what you prefer And the magic is they listen.. They are locally owned and employ Purdue and local folks and that means a lot to my family.\n\nI will say the gravy is usually bland and don't bother ordering biscuits and gravy because they serve the sacrifice biscuits with this. This visit the gravy was on spot and I topped my Merican fries with sausage gravy. I usually gauge biscuits and gravy with white pepper gravy just to be clear. ( Bob Evans is my only exception and GD my all time #1 biscuits and original gravy is unbeatable in this area! Xander wasn't feeling well so he just had hash browns and was hungry when he finished them. It was a huge order of perfectly golden hash browns.\n\nWe have rarely had an issue that isn't immediately addressed and fixed. You would think the servers are part owners. Not perfect but really solid.\n\nRest rooms are a wreck so bring Lysol if your are concerned with that.",

Those in my party enjoyed the skillets dish too. The sandwich was a decent size. Everyone was satisfied with the meal.

My wife had two eggs sunny-side up, hash browns and rye toast. The portions were ample and the eggs were cooked just right. Not surprisingly, Country Café doesn't accept AmEx.\n\nThe cost was very reasonable and our waitress was attentive.

There was a bit of a wait when we got there and the ordering took some time, but that was the only minor concern when going there. Also, it was Sunday morning so it's to be expected. One additional benefit is that the breakfast items are cheap and you get a lot for what you pay. Excellent service from the wait staff, they always would say \"nice to meet you\" and \"welcome\" if it's your first time there. I think they also try to remember people and make them feel at home. That's a great touch in our age of fast food and other restaurants that just move you in and out as quickly as possible. Will come back for sure!",

      "text": "I've been coming to AJ's ever since they opened back in 2008 when I was a Freshman in college. I used to be on their wall of shame for the 1260 challenge back at the River Market location. AJ's specializes in Chicago based food and late night delivery. They are one of the best late night eats along with Fat Franks. They have pivoted from a fast food joint to a fast casual place to essentially a sit down restaurant. Let me start off by saying the new digs were very nice and they had a ton of TVs to watch sports! Also, their beer system is super cool that I've seen on Instagram. But the music was fairly loud and it was club music on a Sunday afternoon with no students...\n\nI stopped by for lunch and it was dead because school's out and COVID-19. The hostess greeted me and had me place an order at the front and then I sat down at a table. I ordered the Chicago dog and mozzarella sticks. I waited for about 20-30 minutes, which was longer than I thought it would be since the place was empty. I did notice that about 2 people came in to pick up orders so maybe that was why. The Chicago looked like a real Chicago dog so presentation was on point. The toppings were excellent, but I think the hot dog may have been slightly undercooked as I felt sick to my stomach after it. The Chicago Dog was $8 so definitely not worth the price. Also, I just checked the menu online and I saw that the Chicago Dog is supposed to come with fries and I definitely did not receive any fries. I don't remember if I was charged $8, but with fries included that makes $8 much more justifiable. Even in Chicago, a Chicago dog is like $5. The breading of the mozzarella sticks were very good, but there was no cheese pull. The marinara sauce was ok, but the ranch was awesome! Also, they gave you a ton of mozzarella sticks for $6. \n\nI've had a lot of items on their menu over time, but I wanted to try something new. But I would not get the Chicago Dog and mozzarella sticks again. My old go-tos used to be their Italian beefs, burgers, CBRs, gyros, loaded waffle fries, and funnel cake sticks. Their prices are expensive for West Lafayette, but the food quality is usually there. Overall, AJ's is a great late night food option and their new digs are pretty sweet! This was a bad experience, but I would give them another shot in the future.",

I'm here on a Thursday night, at the campus AJ's, and it's almost completely empty. \n\nCome on West Lafayette!! It'll be the best burger you ever had in your life, for a rock bottom, bargain price!",

      "text": "Hey Yelp... if you find this review helpful, accurate, amusing or otherwise please follow me. I leave honest reviews with no nonsense. \n\nThis AJ's location 1 of 2 in Lafayette Indiana scores an overall of 2 rounded up from a 1.8.\n\nMy wife and I visited AJ's campus location 12/27/19 during lunch. I had heard that this location is very busy when all the students were in town and I wanted to avoid that. We arrived and first thing we noticed were signs on the small trees out front. \"When you leave drunk don't break my trunk\", I honestly didn't get it at first. Then ahhh haaa... We were greeted by a very friendly hostess who was the only one working the dining room. Perfectly fine because it was slow, very slow. We reminded each other it was Christmas Break. She allowed us to sit where we liked and choose a booth. Once sitting I regretted it. They seem made by the owner or cabinet maker, all wood not comfortable. However the place was nice, clean and everything well kept. \n\nWe were excited about the food. We sat and J ordered sweet tea and I unsweetened, but after the waitress left I realized there was no sweet n low or other sugar substitutes. She returned with the drinks and I asked for sweet n low and she said we don't have non of that but I can throw some sweet on top. I declined but latex subdued because despite my lame attempt to look healthy by ordering unsweetened tea I'm fat and love sweet tea. C'mon I'm from Louisiana what did you expect? We ordered me= Mushroom Swiss with \"new fat\" onion rings and J had the GCB the garlic butter cheese burger with waffle fries. I was warned about everything being fresh and hot but I burned the F#{£ out of my mouth with the first onion ring. I put it down for lesson learned. However this just tells me the kitchen timing was off. Throwing fried food on tight as it goes out. Waffle fries were just as screaming hot. So maybe wait 5 minutes to eat. IDK? My first bite of the mushroom Swiss burger I tasted Beefiness and mushroom but each one after was drowned in mayo, in fact that was the only moisture left aside from what was trapped in the mushrooms. The GCB was void of Garlic and butter!? Not sure what happened there. The bun reminded me of my younger years, desperate for a burger and buying a frozen prepared burger and toasting the bun to save any self dignity a poor young man when trying to gourmet a frozen gas station burger. It looked nice but it was dry, dense and seemed stale. It had a herb or sprinkling of something on top that added a tear the roof of your mouth off texture but nothing more. Bothe burger patties were overcooked and based on the texture I'm assuming pre made and frozen, they were dense and like a fine grind which to me screams cheap beef. When taking your order you know your at a joint that serves the best beef available if they ask what temp you would like your burger. AJ's does not!\n\nSides: Onion rings scored a zero, hell I couldn't taste them remember. Seriously I could but they were doughy greasy and just made my stomach turn, in fact it's 6 hours after eating and my stomach is still in knots. Waffle fries were most definitely frozen and prepared as one would expect. \n\nHere is my assumption great drunken burger joint for game nights and a rushed burger for lunch. I would bet money nothing is made in house from scratch, therefore I place them on a ratings scale with McDonald's. It was not with the $30 we spent for lunch. It's overpriced and we came at a time they should have been blowing people's mind with what they can do. It's a cSh cow on campus for an owner or manager who likely won't throw out stale or bad food! Which is why (as my Cajun uncle would say) my stomach is so torn up I could  through a screen door!",

The burgers here are large and tasty but prices way too high for junk food. Will be back to try more... Eventually....

The sandwich and cheese cup however did and not for the better. \nChicken sandwich use to be nice and crunchy breading with great flavor. It also came on a burger bun. The new one was two chicken strips, not a breast and on a sub sandwich and pressed between what looked like a panini press. The breading on the tenders were oil and discussing.\nThe cheese cup use to be a great nacho cheese, yellow in color and full of flavor.

      "text": "AVOID THIS PLACE!!!!  \n\nUpdate. I left complaint of the below on Twitter, and rather than have them try to straighten this mess out, they deleted my entire post. If you want to know how they treat their customers, read on.\n\nBack in August I went to their previous location and made an order to go. When I got home part of my order was bad. I called and spoke to a manager and she gave me a credit. Earlier tonight I called to verify my credit before placing an order. Once I verified the credit I placed my order. When I arrived to pick up my order the same female manager who originally gave me the credit now claimed there was no credit. I tried to explain,  but when I did the manager began raising her voice claiming she wasn't going to listen to me. This all right as I walked in the door. Even though, i explained the person on the phone confirmed my credit. She replied \"No he didn't\" and although she was the one who originally gave me the credit, she would not honor it\". She explained if the credit isn't listed with my number in the system, it was never there. Meaning that I was lying. What's interesting is my phone records all calls, so not only do I have the original call where she gave me the credit, the counter person confirming my credit, but I was on the phone while she spoke to me like garbage while I tried calmly sort things out. So I have both confirmation of the credit twice, but also the manager treating me like crap all recorded.. This manager decided to beraid me for no reason while continuing to patronize me as well. That said, do not order from here for two simple reasons. One if they screw up your order, forget about them correcting the mistake, your money is gone. And two, Ig the staff decides they feel like it, they will try to make a fool out of you for no reason. In the end, I'm upset with myself for losing my cool after a long drawn out conversation of AJs manager trying her best to upset me and make a fool out of me.  I'm 46 years old and this is the worst abuse of \"power\" I have ever witnessed.",

Then, I realized that the chicken inside was breaded instead of grilled and so instead of eating a BBQ grilled chicken sandwich, I ended up eating chicken tenders doused in BBQ sauce. Although the sauce was homemade, it wasn't notable and lacked flavor. I also got the funnel cake fries which were actually quite good.

However it was still good and healthy tasting. \n\nThe Cobb salad was excellent! very fresh and light. They made it fresh, it wasn't in the fridge.\n\nI'm not a huge fan of an 11$ Cobb salad with chicken.. but it's not a terrible price..\n\nTheir menu is above the cash register. It doesn't have the calories listed on the menu but I asked for a calorie menu and they had a clean laminated one. (A calorie menu is important for a restaurant selling healthy food, right?)\n\nThe only other knock I have on this place is the time it took to make my salad.. It probably took 7 minutes or more.. You may be thinking \"that's not too long of a wait\". Well I thought it was considering there was only 5 other people in the restaurant and 4 were already eating. In the workers defense, there was only 2 of them.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone who enjoys or needs to eat healthy..\n\nIf I'm on the west side and want to eat healthy I will eat there again for sure!",

The decor looks updated and is well laid out.\nOur waiter was extremely friendly and helpful.  We ordered several different items that we were familiar with and a couple that he suggested.  Our food came fairly quickly and tasted fresh.  We were checked on frequently but not to the point of being a bother.  We ordered some more shrimp dumplings because they were so delicious. \nThis is one of the few places I have been tempted to give 5 stars to, but I  will hold off as there were a few items on the menu they didn't have yet.  \nCan't wait to come back.",

      "text": "Visiting out of town - my brother took my boyfriend and I to Xin Asian Bistro for a hearty lunch. We ordered the limited hotpot with Sichuan and Kimchi soup base and beef and lamb as our meats. It was delicious and authentic! Quality meat and vegetable offerings (bok choy, enoki and standard mushrooms, glass noodles, cabbage, and tofu, bean curd), as well as superb fixings to customize your own dipping sauce (sesame oil, green onions, garlic, chili sauce, peanut sauce, chinese barbecue sauce). I was not expecting such a nice set up and really enjoyed our meal! The sichuan was spicy as expected while the kimchi was a more neutral complement.\n\nWe also ordered the \"Snow Ice\" which is their delicious take on shaved ice. The pictures on the menu are inaccurate and totally undersell what this dessert ends up being. They advertised flavors that they didn't offer, but we ordered the mango ice with strawberry milk which came out to be strawberry flavored ice with mango bits, mochi and two pocky sticks (see picture) - super fun and actually one of the better shaved ices I've ever had! The consistency of the ice was a lot fluffier than you'd normally find with asian shaved ice.\n\nWhile there are reviews and perhaps previous experiences of poor service, we actually had a great attentive waitress who appealed to all our extra requests such as additional bowls, spoons, more soup and whatnot. As such, I had no issue with the automatic 18% gratuity and thought Xin Asian Bistro was a gem of a restaurant in Lafayette.",

I liked it a lot. \n\nOur servers were all attentive, quick and overall just good. They more than likely have changed their entire waitstaff since the bad reviews you may see.\n\nWe ordered a bottle of Soju, a Spicy Tofu appetizer and two meals: Yusansel (pork, sea cucumbers, onions, bell peppers) & Pepper Galdi (short ribs in Korean bbq sauce)\n\nWe really liked the Soju here. Also the spicy tofu appetizer was more like a meal and it came with shredded pork on top and a side of rice. Excellent, excellent dish.\n\nThe Yusansel was pretty good, though a tad boring. The short ribs were very good. \n\nOnly complaint is I would have liked the appetizer served first and maybe the meals served about 10 minutes later. The meals came right after the appetizer. \n\nThis place is not cheap. And yes, they charge a 18% mandatory 'tip' (I'll let you figure out why). But for me, I like that - I tip more than 18%, except when it becomes mandatory, in which case the mandate becomes the maximum on principle.\n\nHighly recommend it.",

      "text": "A pretty good example of what happens when 18% gratuity is automatically added to every order (not just large parties like at other places). Result = utterly pathetic awful (lack of) service. We're talking worse-than-McDonald's service here. Our party of 7 decided to eat here because there was a long line at Gaza, and Xin was mostly empty. To start, they give us 5 menus for 7 people. Then, the waiters weren't familiar with their own menu. I mean, when someone points to one of the pictures and says \"this one\" shouldn't they know what to write down? One person in our group ordered a coke, which was never refilled until he had to ask. Another guy had hot water, and when he asked for \"another water\" the waiter brought ice water. Two of the girls ordered the exact same plate of noodles from the menu, but received different things. One of them was so late (over an hour) that the rest of us (6 people!) had all finished eating.\n\nOne or two of these little problems can be excused. So many happening in tandem is a big problem. But the really big problem came when we got the check. As a result of the previously mentioned late noodles, they told us that it was on the house, and gave us a bill totaling $92 (after tax and the automatic gratuity). But when we went to the counter to split the check, they rang us up for $108, charging us for the noodles that they said they wouldn't. When I pointed out the discrepancy, the guy's reply was \"well you didn't say anything earlier [meaning 10 seconds ago] and now I can't undo the splitting of the checks\". He then proceeded to give me a lecture on being honest about how many plates we ordered. After some more arguing, it turned out that he COULD remove the charge for the noodles and split the check again, he just didn't want to. Maybe the customer isn't always right, but when the bill says $92 with the explanation that one order was on the house due to slow service, and you're trying to charge $108 anyways...well, let's just say that Xin won't be missed if it goes out of business.\n\nTo top it all off, the food kind of sucked. Mediocre food + bad service + dishonesty = a recipe for failure, especially in a college town where competition among restaurants is fierce.",

I came for my dinner there ALONE today and ordered just only fish roe soup; however, they charged me 18% tip automatically, which is acceptable for me if their service is good. Unfortunately, it was completely not. Their service is same as simple Asian restaurant in town. The server told me that it is the policy of their restaurant. They are just simple restaurant, not fine-dining one. What the heck I have to pay for 18% service charge!!! This gonna be my last time this stupid restaurant. SUCKXin!!!",

      "text": "So I went to check this place, because it has the same name as mine \"Xin\". I like the food, especially the seafood pancake and jajang noodle, i'd try the kimchi soup next time. The service is not that terrible, but they did forget to bring us spoon, and stuff, and just gave us a big bottle of water so we could refill ourselves, but this is okay for me. The service lady was kinda funny and joking about how my American friends use chopsticks, but not the rude type, my friends seems okay with this. Okay service, if you ask whatever you need, they will bring to you. But they do pre-charge 18% of tips. \nThe food taste really like the kind of Korean food you would find in China, it really similar to one of the Korean restaurant near my alma mater in China, so it kinda remind me of my college life. \nFor those who are vegetarian, there is only one vegetarian dish, mixed vegetable stir-fry with rice. I think that dish is kind of boring, or plain, just they do not put much effort in designing the vegetarian menu, not too much to be surprised of. Their rice is good though, and they use a cute bamboo-like bowl to hold the rice.",

      "text": "The service was slow and inattentive. I made eye contact with our server multiple times and signaled for her to come over, but multiple times I was ignored, even though she clearly saw me. I ordered the Hawaiian poke bowl and my companion ordered the spicy tuna bowl. Mine was dry and bland, without the rich marinated flavor I expect of a traditional Hawaiian poke. His was not at all spicy, just covered in a pinkish mayo. It was also dry. The quality, however, was not as off-putting as the service. A new server brought out the food and as we began eating with the chopsticks at the table, he came back with spoons we did not ask for and jammed them into our bowls while we were eating from them without even asking if we wanted spoons. Spoiler: we are quite comfortable with chopsticks and did not want spoons, especially not rammed into bowls as we ate. We were never asked how the food was nor if we needed anything. We paid by card at the table with a tablet credit card reader. After he swiped my card and I signed, he grabbed the iPad away at the screen asking if I wanted a receipt. I reached after it but he kept going and hit \"no receipt\" for me, without asking. I told him I wanted a receipt and he offered to send the receipt of my companion to me instead without apology, apparently not learning his lesson and assuming he did not want his receipt either. Super rude, subpar service with subpar food. I would not recommend this place to anyone.",

I appreciated that it was actually spicy and not toned down. It did have a lot of cabbage, but I love cabbage so I was okay with that.\n\nThe dining area is styled nicely. Lots of large booths and some tables in the open area. It was freezing when I was there, which was not comforting on a snowy day.",

When I first heard about this place I was a little hesitant to try it cause it's \"vegetarian\", but there are plenty of meat options and add-on possibilities. They have everything from salads, grain bowls, to soups! There are dozens of add on veggies and plenty of dressings to choose from. \n\nI had the tuna poke salad and it was amazing! Such a big portion size, I only ate half my bowl and I was full. So, 2 meals for $12 - yes!! I've seen reviews for the coconut curry and the ranch steak and I am definitely coming back to try them!\n\nThey also have a super mesmerizing juice bar! They have different lemonades, punches, and juice. I tried the watermelon juice and coconut water fruit punch - both amazing. Definitely worth the extra couple bucks since the refills are free! :)\n\nHighly recommend going here! Great \"fast food\" that's very healthy and very delicious! Amazing option for people who are trying to eat healthy but not very creative (like me lol).",

Every option sounded delicious, so i I had a difficult time picking, but I'm sure everything is worth a try!\n\nI ended up with the chicken coconut curry soup and it was great.  My husband tried the ranch flank steak with root vegetables and love it as well.  My dad opted for the Poke bowl-I snuck a few bites and know I'll be getting that next time for sure. Our little one got the kids protein plate-chicken, mandarin oranges, rice, corn, and cucumbers with ranch! \n\nThe staff were super friendly, offered samples to us, and were attentive through the entire experience.  \n\nThe decor is bright and they offer a ton of fresh juice options as well.  I also saw that if you download the app and made an online order you get $5 off--so I'll have to remember that for next time too.  \n\nIt is a tad pricey, but you get what you pay for.  I'll gladly pay a little more for healthy, quality ingredients.",

They were also out of a bunch of things, and didn't know until like 15 minutes after the orders were placed.

This is a plus for me because I'm not a huge fan of very crowded restaurants where you feel like you don't have any privacy from other patrons. (I also don't believe in the idea that a restaurant has to be overflowing with customers at all times to be making good food.) You can definitely tell Chumley's is a sports bar with its center focused on Indiana because Colts and Purdue gear decorates the walls. I love the cozy, local spirit of the place! \n\nI decided to build my own burger using a Beyond Burger because I don't eat red meat anymore (not pictured is that my friend got a regular burger done medium-well and it looked just as tasty) and, as a self-proclaimed toppings man, loaded it up with veggies, hot peppers, guacamole and (trust me on this) pineapple. The heat from the peppers mixed with the charred-sweetness of the pineapple made for a dazzling and intriguing blend of flavors! The chips and dip on the side were a nice, refreshing change of pace every few bites and the pickle spear had a great crunch. I thought the Beyond patty held its weight and really brought all the flavors in the burger together.\n\nI might have to make this burger my go-to instead of the wings!!!",

The ones I got were warm, kind of flat, and most that are on the beer list aren't quality craft beer; it's stuff like Miller Light, Bud Light and Budweiser. You can't really tell what your ordering since a lot of beers only have \"rotating\" as their description and they won't write it on the flight board. Our waiter wasn't very informative or prepared either. The Long Island my boyfriend ordered was so sweet he couldn't finish even half of it. The nachos were a big portion, but cold and there was not much guacamole like suggested on the menu. My water cup was dirty and you don't get water unless you ask. We went to watch a basketball game, they do have plenty of TVs that are really nice.",

      "text": "We decided to try Chumley's for dinner and drinks last night with 5 of my friends.  Two of us decided to go early before the rest showed up and ordered drinks and three appetizers. The drinks did come out in a timely fashion but no appetizers for 45 minutes. We were not in any rush but our waiter did come to let us know, after a extended about of time, they were out of two of our appetizers. The rest of our dining experience was not up to par by any means.  Food was subpar and and beer was rather warm.  I always try to give places the benefit of the doubt, but I will more than likely not be coming back. No help with our bill or acknowledgment that they did a poor job. Wish them the best and hope this was a rare occurrence, but just a lack of awareness for a lackluster dinner experience.",

      "text": "So, we've been here a couple of times in the past few years. A couple of years ago, we visited in the afternoon after a poorly attended Purdue football game. We met a bunch of friends in the back and had a great seating area and great service. The friends we met were local to Lafayette and regulars. The food was fine, regular standard bar food really, but it was good. The drinks were flowing and the service was great. So, overall, we had a good experience.\n\nThis past year, we went back, remembering our prior experience. The place was much busier than the last time we'd been there, but we got lucky and got a 4 top booth very quickly - up towards the front of the restaurant. Our server was nice, but the service was VERY slow. The food took forever to come out (we didn't order much - just wings and a burger, and maybe one more item) and we had a tough time getting fresh beers. It was just a completely different experience. The quality of the food felt like it had gone down too. \n\nIt was so different than our first visit. That's when I got on Yelp to see what people were saying. Well, it all made sense because the things that I found less than fantastic were the same things that people had been commenting on as well. Again, I feel like the people that work there are friendly enough. I hate to write it off after one good visit and one terrible visit, but not sure that this would make our list next time around if we weren't already meeting some locals there.",

After forgetting my ID, driving 30 mins to get it and come back, the bouncer still wouldn't believe me that my ID was legit (I was 26 years old at the time) because I'm from out of state and he didn't recognize it, even though there are several security features in my license. (It was even an under 21 license, since it was renewed on my 20th birthday--who would get a fake under 21 license?!) When he demanded a 2nd form of ID, he refused to tell us what would pass for ID even when we asked. He was really awful toward us, and we don't even drink, so definitely not worth the hassle. My husband got the manager when he got in to come look at my ID, who verified it was in fact legit, and let us in to join our friends who had been there for 45 mins at this point. \n\nService to our table was extremely slow--a lot of our friends got their first drinks and apps 5-10 mins after I got in, even though it was a Monday night and the place was dead. The manager (who was the only good thing about the place--he was helpful) offered me a free drink or side for our trouble. We ordered a side, and after not getting it for almost an hour, we asked our server about it. Turns out the order was lost. After 45 mins of ID fighting/driving and over an hour in the restaurant, we had no food or drinks to show for it. We left at that point.\n\nNeither I nor my husband never had a more difficult and terrible experience at a restaurant or bar before in our lives. Not only are we never going back, we tell all our friends not to go there either.",

I liked the atmosphere - dark and old-timey, in spite of the plasma tellies - and the servers were very courteous - the most courteous I have ever come across, in fact, so that was a very pleasant surprise. \n\nEverything is very overpriced compared to the other bars/pubs in the vicinity, though - I've only seen 9 Irish Brothers beat their prices for food and drink. 9 Irish, though, gives you a hefty amount of food for the price, such that you do not feel too ripped off. For the $12 I paid for a donut burger, plus something like $2 just to get some real fries instead of the Lays-like potato chips they serve with it for free, I was expecting quite a large, decadent sandwich with a good portion of fries. Instead, I got a pretty average patty on a donut that disintegrated with handling, such that by the end, I was pretty much holding the patty,  while I would say I only got about the equivalent amount of a medium serving of fries at McDonalds. It was good, but I left hungry. I have had meals that were $4-5 cheaper, about the same quality, but with quite a bit more food than what you will get here.",

Perfectly seasoned. Perfectly cooked.\n-Mac and cheese was creamy and delicious. \n-Service I received over the phone and at pickup was phenomenal. Extremely polite. \n-Silverware they supplied actually held up to the chop. \n\nCons:\n-if I was nitpicking I would say an online ordering and easier pickup feature would be nice but the foods worth a little work. \n\nI'll be having lunch here  every Thursday now!",

      "text": "Decided to try the place with my wife and daughter after moving to Lafayette from Central Texas 3 years ago. I've been very skeptical of all bbq/smokehouses in Indiana as it's just different from what I expect. That said I've learned that it is what it is. Arriving I told my family \"think positive\"! We arrived around 12:30 and I noticed meat under a heat lamp in a display case and a rather disorganized front end. Then we were greeted with EXTREME hospitality. Very impressed! The gentleman taking our order was very patient with my daughter which is a really big deal for me. She ordered the smoked chicken with sides of Mac n cheese and mash potatoes and gravy. The chicken was pulled from the heat lamp. My wife ordered the sliced brisket plate with baked potato salad and Mac and cheese. I being a Coon Ass (cajun) saw the catfish special, paired it with green beans and corn, I also had to try the \"Texas Brisket\" so I ordered a half pound. Here is the food break down and then my pet peeve that ruined the whole experience. 0-5 but with a caveat allowing one decimal. \n\nSmoked Chicken 3.5 (flavorful but dry)\nTexas Smoked Brisket 2.9 ( 1 order juicy 1 dry, void of true Texas Smoke Flavor) this is just Indiana brisket which is fine but not Texas smoked brisket as advertised. \nFried Catfish 5 (absolutely amazing)\nSides - Corn, Green Beans, Baked Potato Salad all rate 5 (seasoned perfect and correct temp and just wonderful) \nMac n Cheese 2.5 ( step it up guys this was boring fake cheese nonsense and can easily be improved because the pasta was perfect).\n\nSweet Tea 4.2 was great but mixed in a little regular to cut the sweet for my taste. POP  Rated 3 syrup to carbonation and lemonade was EAH. Maybe switch to single serve options?\n\nThe MAJOR problems. A hair in my 1/2 lb. order of sliced mediocre brisket. Black fungus matter in my daughters ice. \n\nI did not capture a picture of the ice but was at the self serve station but she showed me and I had her discard it. The place was getting busy and I had no intentions of ruining my afternoon and we were basically getting refills but it along with the hair made me sick to my stomach. I would have notified the staff but again a scene was not why I was there but YES I reported this to the health department because it's a health hazard to many restaurants do not pay attention too. The hair is what it is and it happens. I ate half of one slice and closed the styrofoam container and discarded it entirely.\n\nLast comments because I am fully aware these people care about their business. The clutter around the place along with the two old men sitting in the back room by the restroom are a distraction from you business. Eliminate the \"TEXAS\" phrase unless you can or have passed the test. I'm willing to go brisket for brisket to show you what I mean.  Styrofoam and hot food is not appealing. I guess choose what you want to be great at and do it. Your restaurant could kill South Street Smoke house if you weren't distracted by Catering. Lastly if Yelp allowed my rating would be a 2.9 but with the hair and moldy ice I refuse to round up!",

Very tender and mild flavor. The BBQ sauce is sweet, as in Sweet Baby Rays brand.  That was a disappointment. Don't get me wrong that is a good BBQ sauce. I was hopping for something homemade. The next choice was spicy or Carolina with a vinegar flavor. I liked it. No brand stated. \nCaned corn was flavored.  And the mashed potatoes were garlic and did not need the brown gravy.  \n\nWorth eating at. But not the best.",

He was very kind and patient through the process and I look forward to updating my review in the near future. Looks like the menu had an error on the grubhub app which was not caught when they were first contacted. \n\nPaid $24 on grub hub for the $17 two meat two side chicken meal. They gave us about a breast worth of chicken and a scoop each of Mac and cheese and mashed potatoes. The chicken was fine but bland, and accompanied by sweet baby rays. Incredibly disappointed there just because BBQ is in the name of the restaurant but they have to give us little sweet baby rays cups? Mac and cheese was decent but nothing special, and the potatoes and gravy were pretty good. This meal was well over double what it should have cost. It was billed as double meat but that would make one meat less than a kid's portion. How they can continue to get customers with mind boggling prices and low effort food is beyond me, but I've learned my lesson and won't be wasting money here again. I'll be sticking to South Street.",

I ordered the brisket plate and added a Nashville hot chicken drumstick to it as it was the special of the day. The person helping me was about as friendly as a shoe and although I'm sure he spoke English, he proved that he knew about 3 words during the entire exchange. \n\nFor my sides I ordered Mac-n-chee' and beans. I'm gonna be honest the beans were easily the best thing on the plate. The brisket was over cooked and poorly smoked. The smoke had hardly penetrated the meat and the smoke ring was nonexistent. The meat was tough, and lack luster at best. I actually had to ask for sauce and what I received was pretty much Sweet Baby Ray's sauce with tabasco. Yet again, huge fail. The Mac and cheese was ok, but it's pretty hard to mess that up, so kudos there. The Nashville hot chicken tasted exactly like fried buttermilk batter and nothing else. Not even a hint of hot chicken. Fried chicken, yes. Nashville hot chicken, Hell no.  \n\nAll in all, it was mediocre at best. My advice: get your shit together and stop serving brisket if you can't do it justice.  You're not in Texas, so quit acting like it.",

The sides are all very good (stay away from the mac and cheese, that's MINE!), with ample portions served. There are also a variety of cold sides available. Ask for the banana pudding. Although not as good as mine, it's pretty good stuff. \n\nTheir gem, though, is broasted chicken. I would come here when I was a student at Purdue for their broasted chicken, on my limited student budget. It is that good. Crispy on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside. Much better chicken than at many of the bbq and chicken shacks I have visited in my travels. \n\nAlthough D&R is a bit on the pricy side, it is well worth a try.

      "text": "This is hands down the best place in Lafayette. The food is delicious, the ice cream is so good, but above all that the people are great. They are so friendly and they are willing to modify anything for you. Example, I love empanadas and especially their empanadas locas, I asked one time if it was possible to get them but without frying them. Sure enough they were able to get me the filling in smaller tortillas. Another example, I like to get the escamocha which is a huge bowl of fresh fruit that is covered in crema, but one day (10 pounds later) I decided I want to have it without the cream. Sure enough I get the beautiful bowl of fresh cut fruit with no cream. The reason I appreciate all that is because I've been to all type of restaurants around here and I don't dare to change a thing. I usually would get the \"we can't do that\", \"we don't do that\", \"that will be extra but also not the way you want it\".\n\nBottom line, best place and best people ever . The best coconut ice cream too can't forget to say that.",

      "text": "Mango Loco is a pretty nondescript storefront in a small corner strip mall. There are entrances to the parking lot on both Sagamore parkway and Greenbush street.\n\nGiven the relative unimpressiveness of the exterior, the inside was very nice. Fresh looking paint. A drop ceiling without stains and holes. A nicely appointed wall splitting the dining are from the kitchen area. Tables that didn't wobble....I gotta be honest, I expected the decor to be \"shithole mexican\" but it was really nice.\n\nService was not too fast, but not too slow. Really nice guy serving and I glimpsed a woman who i think was doing the cooking, so having two employees is already a step up on some small Mexican restaurants I've patronized around town.\n\nI ordered Chicharrones Preparados, a mixed (pork and cheese) Pupusa, Steak Tostada, Marinated Pork Sope.\n\nThe Chicharrones Preparados was pretty bad. Mind you, I think they did the item right, but I was thinking it was a big pork rind with stuff on top from what I saw on the menu. Turns out it is a big fake pork rind, topped with stuff, that is also topped with pickled/soft pork rinds. The soft pork rinds just did not work for me. Swing and a miss.\n\nPupusa was very soft, had a good sauce with it and was filling. Pretty bread-y, FYI.\n\nSteak Tostada was the best item. Very crunchy tortilla, nice tomato slice covered in Mexican cheese sprinkles and an avocado slice all with some crema and lettuce. Excellent item.\n\nThe sope was also very good. The marinated pork (aka Al Pastor) had pineapple chunks in it which surprised me. I didn't dislike it, just surprising. Overall the item was delicious.\n\nNo chips and salsa were served at 11:30 a.m.\n\nPrice-wise this place is very cheap. $16 after tax for an appetizer, three small items & and a side.  \n\nMy daughter enjoyed her rice, but the beans were pretty weird. A combo of whole pinto beans in a sauce of refried beans. Not good.\n\nMango Loco is worth a try. I was leaning towards three stars, but because of how cheap their food is, I went with four.",

      "text": "I have been looking for a real Mexican Restaurant in the Lafayette/ West Lafayette area.  I think I have finally found it.  It is almost across the street from Taco Rico's, on the corner of Greenbush and Sagamore Parkway in the strip mall there.\n\nNo I can not say that much yet, because I went with my two daughters for their Friday Taco deal.  The tacos are now $1.25, up from $1.00 like they were a year ago.\n\nI had three tacos, a beef, pork and chicken.  The all were very, very good.  In fact they are the best Mexican food I have had anywhere in this area.  My daughter had the enchiladas, and they were good, but not as good as the tacos. One of my daughters had some lemonade which was very good, and the other had a mango milkshake, which was out of this world. \n\nAfter being there for a while, I realized I had finally found the right place.  The entire time we were there, we were the only people there who had not been born in Mexico, or some other Hispanic country that had come in. \n\nI am looking forward to going back, and trying some of the other things they have, but it is going to be hard to stay away on Fridays for their great tacos at a fantastic price.",

The location is just a bit outside of downtown on 4th street but not too bad if you're used to going to the market downtown on Saturdays. \n\nThe bread here is on point. The sourdoughs are amazing but my go to is the baguette. It's got a great crumb on the outside but nice and chewy on the inside.  At $4 a loaf, it is a great affordable price point.\n\nDon't forget their croissants either. I had the opportunity to have one of their fresh baked almond croissant right out of the oven and it was perfect.\n\nThis place is worth making a trip to Lafayette alone and is a great bakery in the community. You can also find them at the the local farmers markets .",

I got a chocolate croissant for breakfast tomorrow. My co worker I was with had one while we were there and he said it was amazing.",

Smittybread is a bakery on par with what you would find in any Hipster capital in the country.\n\nDiscovering this bakery absolutely changed my attitude towards living in Indiana, and is a worth the drive from anywhere in the region. Anyone driving through Lafayette should absolutely stop. Those living local should make them their go to for all of your bread needs.\n\nSmittybread specializes in sourdough and has a decidedly French take on bread. Their baguettes are some of the best I've ever had, as good as those I've had in France. My favorite is taking a bite off of still warm baguette before I even make it out the door, a baguette that never even makes it home. Your taste buds, your friends, and your friend's taste buds, will thank you for checking out Smitybread.",

I ordered a buffalo burger, rare, but what I got was definitely medium-well - no pink anywhere to be found.

It's not in a great location but that adds a bit to the country vibes. Us three guys were served up immediately having to take a good moment to look over the huge menu and observe the many creative and fantastic ideas, reuben omelet!? Well ok! We went for the good stuff as my photos show, breakfast burrito and eggs benedict too. I have to commend these people on wonderful attention to giving proper good eats at fair prices that combined with quality easy heating entrees makes for the most universal restaurant in the area. This is the place for anyone, anytime! We will definitely be back for me to sample the whole menu by year's end. I loved the chili, my buddy ravaged the burrito, and the corned beef wasn't messed up at all as too common for small homely spots to do. Made for a mouthwatering original omelet tho we felt the thousand island could better serve a drizzle inside along with the beef and sauerkraut. The atmosphere features the usual TVs for a few games and large bar but twas too early for us to sample. We noticed a good assortment of cars in the parking lot from a newer BMW Z4 with the twin turbo inline 6 to a Smart car further adding to my opinion this is a spot for everyone! Will be back very soon!",

They stopped allowing smoking in there a while ago, and I couldn't really smell the residue either. They also had a really nice outdoor seating area in front of the bar. Not sure if that's a smoking section or just standard seating. \n\nI ordered the six buffalo wing appetizer & breaded tenderloin sandwich with waffle fries. \n\nFood was served on metal trays. I thought that was a great divey touch. Wings tasted pretty good, though very light on the sauce. They are seasoned well so even without much sauce I enjoyed these. Ranch was not great.\n\nTenderloin sandwich was head-sized as expected. I suspect they marinate it nicely before breading and cooking, because this was very juicy and flavorful. Tiny tomato on top, but again, that's expected. You just don't get many toppings on tenderloin sandwiches. \n\nPossibly the best (of many) tenderloin I've had in town. Waffle fries were overcooked, but still ok.\n\nIf you're interested in eating bar food, this is a good option and I would recommend trying it out. Prices are reasonable. 10% check-in coupon on Yelp right now, though you should mention that to your server when you arrive - mine brought the bill before I could do so.",

First, our waitress made it seem like she was too busy or that we were inconveniencing her by coming in. Then, after we placed our order, we waited 40 minutes just to receive our food. \n\nI asked for hash browns with onions, and I received hash browns with raw onions sprinkled on top? We ordered 1 Bloody Mary and received two, which was fine because I was willing to drink it, but it was made with some cheap vodka and just wasn't that good.\n\nOverall just not as great as I had hoped. Having one server and one person in the kitchen may not be normal, maybe we just came on the wrong day? But I definitely will not be coming back anytime soon.",

I ordered the classic breaded tenderloin sandwich, the barometer by which all dive bars in Indiana are measured. The tenderloin itself was too large for the bun as is required. It came hot and the tenderloin was delicious. It was the rest where the sandwich fell apart, literally. There was one small slice of tomato and a bit of lettuce. I put mayo on the bun and it fell apart immediately when I picked it up. I upgraded to waffle fries with cheese. There really wasn't much cheese to even notice, although the waffle fries were crisp. Luckily it costs only pennies to upgrade the fries. Many of my dining companions ordered the chicken and noodles which comes poured over a scoop of mashed potatoes as most Hoosiers prefer. They raved about the homemade-like noodles. One diner asked for an order to go but it was sold out! It must be a Thursday special because it's not on the menu. Go for lunch on Thursday and go early if you hope to get any. I was happy enough with the food, the company, and the service to consider returning. And the prices are dirt cheap.",

      "text": "Yes Yes Yes! \n\nI have lived in Crawfordsville, IN for 19 years and have been back and forth to Lafayette so many times. I moved to Baltimore, MD over 10 years ago and continue to come back and forth to see family and friends in Indiana. During a visit this past week to Lafayette to see a friend, he took me to the diner. I had no idea it existed and I wish I had a long time ago. \n\nWe walked in, were asked to sit on a specific side of the diner due to COVID. We happily found a booth, sat down, and had one of the diner servers come over, dropped off menus and quickly asked what we wanted to drink. I'm from the east coast now and am very used to quick and rapid service but wasn't ready for that kind of rapid answer. I was thrown off guard, no worries though. I was able to just quickly get a coffee ordered and thumb through the breakfast menu. \n\nI ordered coffee and a bacon, egg, and cheese sandwich. After about 1 minute, coffee arrived, five minutes later, here comes the sandwich, which was awesome! After about 15 - 20 minutes of enjoying quick breakfast, my friend and I paid our $5.00 for coffee and sandwiches each and headed out. \n\nBIG take-aways for me:\n- Quick service\n- COVID friendly (at that time) with masks worn by all\n- Spacing out of all customers\n- VERY cost friendly with great food! \n\nThank you for a positive first experience at the diner. I definitely will be visiting again when I come back.",

The place was horribly packed, staff not wearing masks over noses, no social distancing and they were on a wait with people piled up. They took my number to call me when a table was ready. The girl took my number down wrong so we waited for 20 minutes outside for nothing.\n\nThey were over ran with Togo and Grubhub orders, so people inside were waiting an hour for food. An hour wait for some over easy eggs is just sad. Server was sweet and apologetic for the slow experience, but total with the wait, we were there for 2 hours. That's insane. Toilet was leaking all over bathroom floor and pie. Awe was filled with uncovered pies that looked nasty. Only reason for two stars was a nice server and food tasted good when we finally got it.

      "text": "It's the little things that set the stage for a great experience or a lack luster disappointment. For starters the greeting, Southside flunks by leaving costumers waiting awkwardly by the door while the staff bustles around. The \"hostess\" greeted customers from the back of the room or second seating area with a menu waving come here motion. No good morning, hello, welcome to Southside. Second the booth we were sat at had a tear in the seat that was the size of a small child (picture attached). The booth was positioned where I had 24\" between myself and the table edge as was my wife's side which made for an uncomfortable sitting on the edge of the booth. I'm 6'4\" and 290lbs and there was room for another me between me and the table. Third, the table had a wobble that spilled our drinks this prompting a sweet and low shimming. The server was very friendly but absent minded. We asked for more cream when we were served our coffee and waters and explained we needed a little more time to peruse the menu. Server returned 10 minutes later to ask for our order, still no cream for my wife to doctor her coffee to her liking. A reminder was provided and she promptly retrieved some.\n\nI had the philly cheese omelette no green peppers with American cheese, home fries and a single biscuit and gravy. My wife ordered the breakfast platter and a single pancake. The food was not bad but nothing to brag about. Home fries void of flavor and came out cold. Omelette was cooked to a rubbery texture and the biscuits and gravy was horrible. Gravy was bland and biscuit seemed stale needing a knife to hack through it. My wife's over easy eggs were cooked well but same home fries and back was cold and chewy. Pancake was good from my wife's perspective, I tried and wouldn't order if we were to return. I salvaged my home fries thanks to the cholula hot sauce which I love. If it was food alone I would rate it a 2.5 out of 5. \n\nThe booth adjacent to ours we learned as we dined was a either a previous employee or a current off duty employee. Her waitress was not ours and neither of them was capable of keeping their tone down or mouths shut as they both openly railed about one of the owners (female). It was very unprofessional to listen to. \n\nSo there you have it. Despite having a friendly but absent minded waitress ourselves the remainder of the staff from my perspective was non attentive to their tables or busy flirting with the bus boy. No one seemed to be in charge. We waited but did not receive.

Food, silverware, trash - all over the floors. We were a party of 5, and no table could accommodate us (except the side they closed off). They wanted to cram us into a small booth and pull up a chair. Those tables are barely big enough for 4, let alone a 5th. \n\nI'll never go here again, in favor of place that isn't a literal garbage dump, who cares about customers and bringing in revenue, and is competent enough to know not to close half the place over a Saturday lunch hour.",

So when we were visiting Lafayette, Indiana at Purdue for UC/Purdue game I saw we were close to one and we had to go try it. \n\nIt's actually still an old school drive in. We pulled up, read the menu. Hit a button on the speaker, a girl took our order. Then she ran out on a tray, asked me to roll my window down a decent amount and stuck the tray with all our yummy food on it on my window. \n\nWe ordered a Coney Dog basket and two super Root Beer Floats. Easily the best Root Beer Floats we've ever had. Big frosted mugs. Pure perfection. The Coney was super good too. I actually liked the chili on the Coney a lot. The crinkle fries that came with the basket were typical crinkle fries. They weren't bad at all they just...were crinkle fries. \n\nWe flipped the switch on the speaker and the girl came back out and got our tray. Then we headed back to Cincy with some delicious food in our stomachs. Next time we're back I'll defiantly be stopping back and hitting up Dog-N-Suds again.",

Similar to a Sonic, you have the option to drive up into a parking spot and order your meal and have it brought out to your car. This is not my favorite way to eat, but for those who enjoy that, Dog N Suds is the place for you in the Greater Lafayette area.\n\nIf that doesn't strike your fancy, they have a little pavilion spot for you to sit and eat at if you'd prefer, which is what I will probably do in the future.\n\nThe food is what you'd expect. It wasn't mind-blowing or anything, but it was enjoyable for what we wanting and expecting. The service was prompt too in ordering and coming to get your tray if you are eating from your car.\n\nNow get out there and enjoy a tasty hot dog and some delicious root beer while it's hot as heck out here in the Midwest.",

We got foot longs with coney sauce which were good, but the shrimp basket is nothing but frozen shrimp from Sam's club ( tasting) and then dumped in a basket with mediocre coleslaw. \n\nOur food while good, was not good enough to warrant another trip anytime soon. Especially if you are ordering outside.",

In high school and a couple years of college I worked at Dog N Suds, I would still eat here every day if I could  I think that says a lot since I worked here and would still eat here. Every time I go back to Lafayette I make sure I stop at Dog N Suds. You have to try a root beer in a mug, make sure to order a Large to get the mug. You can also get baby root beers in a mug too! I would suggest a foot long coney cheese dog, I like to add onions and mustard to mine. Their shrimp basket is delicious. I also enjoy the coney cheese burger. If you get fries or onion rings make sure you ask for the special sauce, it's a mix of mayo and mustard and is sweet and delicious! If you like ice cream you can't go wrong with a root beer float or a freeze, the only difference is they blend the root beer float for a freeze. I love Dog N Suds and will always be a fan!",

It tickles my nostalgic senses when I'm back in my old stomping grounds to make a sentimental stop at my favorite drive-in.

The stuff that makes you go \"Ah!\" after taking a big swig. \n- Drink it. \n- Order another one to-go.\n- Next, order a footlong coney dog and a tenderloin sandwich. Nothing says \"Indiana girl\" like a good breaded tenderloin. \n- Eat it. \n- Now, sit back, relax and order a root beer float. \n- Devour it while enjoying to some classic rock radio. \n\nI'm so sad that there isn't a Dog N' Suds in Indy. There are days I'm half tempted to make the 45 minute drive to get a $3 hotdog. Yes, THAT good.",

The corn tortillas were freshly made and didn't fall apart while eating them. The rice and beans were flavorful - nothing unique just rice and beans. Not too wet, not too dry. Not under seasoned or too spicy - just right. They offered soda in bottles and cans with no fountain drinks.\n\nIn general the restaurant is small as there are six tables for four and a bar like table for four more. It's a place when packed is crammed but the food is good and fairly priced for the generous portions.\n\nThe location is in an interestingly odd location, as it is located next to a muffler shop........

The salsa had a good kick to it that I enjoyed!\n\nLuckily, my boyfriend's burrito came with chips that were better! The menu indicated that the al pastor tacos came with a slice of grilled pineapple, so I was disappointed to see that my tacos came with literally the smallest slivers of pineapple LOL it was honestly very sad. The tacos and burrito were just okay in my opinion. I've had better in town! The tortillas were a little dry. \n\nVerdict: Eh, I'll come back if I'm ever in the area, but there are so many other mexican restaurants I want to try in town first!",

Taco Tuesday prices are for dine-in only.\n\nWe also had the chori queso, which was good, but did not have near enough chips served with it and expensive. I also didn't like the fact that they only have bottled water and plastic forks. \n\nThe space is nicely updated and modern.",

Otherwise, it's pretty hard to know about this place coming from West Lafayette.\n\nI'm from Chicago and I've been to a handful of taco spots in the city, and I can say that these tacos are BETTER than most that I've tasted in Chicago! I've been to a few taco/Mexican restaurants in the Lafayette area and nothing comes even close to Las Brazas Taqueria in how good it is.\n\nEverything that goes into the taco taste exceptionally fresh. The meats are very flavorful and taste as authentic as it gets. To add to that, you have a variety of sauces and hot toppings to give your food a little more kick. The servers are very courteous and helpful. Overall, the energy in the place is great too. They really like their customers too!\n\nAn easy 5/5 for this one!",

The owners did a great job with the interior. There are caddys with green (mild) and red (hot) sauces.\n\nI got the asada tacos and asada burrito. The grilled corn tortillas are a bit small, and are piled with ingredients, making a potentially sloppy meal. The asada had a slight seasoning, and was tender. The burrito was stuffed with meat, refried beans, and Mexican rice. Flavor-wise, I believe the menu was tailored for local gringo tastes, so be advised the sauces are not there for looks. Everything was good, but needed more heat. \n\nThe service was good and friendly, with mom going about the dining room bussing and cleaning tables, and talking to the customers. As this place is small, it fills up quickly and can have the perception of being hectic. Plusses for being open late.",

The first time I ate the entire burrito and was absolutely stuffed!  This time I only ate half of it and I feel perfect.\nMy burrito had shredded beef, pico, letter, cheese, beans and rice with the mild sauce.  The temperature was perfect everything was Fresh and my shredded beef was tender.

The food is delicious with large portions and good prices.  Some of the older reviews state that they are cash only but I am happy to announce that they now accept credit cards.  The location was once probably prime but the surrounding area has turned into a high crime area so I would recommend ensuring that you're finished with your meal and out of the area by dark.  I would presume that this is why their seasonal hours have them closing shop around nightfall.  However, go here and give this place a try.  The burgers and malts are a must get.  The fries are also phenomenal; reminiscent of the old Burger King fries before the government stepped in and ruined them. The staff is always friendly and quick with the food preparation.  Your patronage here helps to support an iconic mom and pop establishment which is respectful enough to include an in memoriam on their window for a local fallen firefighter who was killed in the line of duty.  The only thing I am disappointed about is that it took me this long to find this gem and would encourage everyone to give it a try sooner rather than later.",

The only con is that it is a cash only place, but it's is fairly cheap, so just grab some spare change and check this place out. We can only vouch for their ice cream, as that is all we have had, however they do offer other fast foods (burgers, fries,...) \n\nI usually get the strawberry flavor burst medium cone ($1.99) and have been delighted by it, so much that it is what I usually get when I go. However, their flurries are a must try, and they come in a variety of flavors, ranging from oreos to snickers to reeses. Best part is that the chocolate brand of your choosing is crushed and is mixed uniformly throughout the ice cream so that you don't have to worry of mixing it yourself as happens when ordering Flurries at other locations.\n\nIf it were not for the cash only, I would consider giving Budges five stars, but on second thought, them not accepting cards is probably a good thing for us.\n\nNext time we head over to Budges, we'll take pictures of their menu so that you can get an idea of what to expect.",

I ordered Thai iced tea, a side of fried tofu, and a tofu sandwich with mayo. \nOnce my order was placed I waited outside for about 15 minutes - next time I'll order through the YELP app so I dont have to wait. They have a black bench to sit on but no outdoor seating to eat at.\nMy takeout food came in a nice little brown paper bag and the thai tea had a boba tea lid which made carrying everything so much easier. \nThe thai tea was not very sweet. However, what it lacked in sweetness it made up for in creaminess - over all, very yummy. \nThe sandwich was soooo good! It's a big sandwich for $7! The bread was toasted, tofu crispy, cilantro gave it a burst of flavor and freshness, and the pickled vegetables brought it all home with just enough acidity to rock your socks off. \nAnd last but not least was the fried tofu side. So perfectly crispy and the sauce gave it a wonderful tangy flavor. \nOverall I highly recommend this place. Order ahead so you dont have to wait, but even if you have to wait its really worth it.",

I definitely miss it since I don't live there anymore and was so glad to see Lafayette had a place that serves up both. This was my first time ordering here. I got the marinated pork sandwich for pick up. I loved it right away. The first bite alone was full of flavor! \n\nI think I'd give it five stars if the meat was just a little more savory, there was a little more filling, and if the bread was fresher (felt a little stale). \n\nAll in all, a super satisfying 7 dollar sandwich! I'm definitely coming back to order pho and more sandwiches!",

I got the classic for my son, and the marinated pork for me. The sandwiches were larger than I thought they would be (very filling), and a great value for the price. There was plenty of meat and vegetables on them, and the baguette was perfect. The marinated pork was so good, the flavor reminded me of my favorite noodle bowl I get at Green Leaf (their sister restaurant).\n\nThe interior is very clean and modern, and larger that it looks on the outside. The parking lot is small, but there is plenty of street parking on Owen Street.",

      "text": "This review is mostly for the banh mi, because that was the only item I ordered personally, but I have to comment on the nuoc cham because I tried some! Got the classic /dac biet combo banh mi. I didn't try the meats individually (should have!), but I liked the savoriness and how they tasted. Pickled carrots and radish were a little on the sweet side, but I liked how they were cut (not too thick nor thin), liked how they gave a generous portion of the pickles, and that they used English cucumbers for an actual crunch, and that jalapenos were not omitted! I really enjoyed the shattering and flaky crust on the bread, and that it wasn't TOO crusty or hard to cut the soft palette or to be semi-compressed (in order to eat all components in one bite). My friend got the fried tofu, which she loved, but I tried some of her nuoc cham with some of the tomatoes/cucumbers that came with it, and encouraged her to try some on her rice! She didn't like the nuoc cham, and I was disappointed that it was overwhelmingly fishy and sweet, almost like it was missing the lime juice to balance it out, because I have fond memories of almost drowning my broken rice in nuoc cham. Most definitely will be back for the banh mi, but would wait to order any rice dish because of the off-putting nuoc cham!\n\nThe above review was written 3 months ago, after my first visit to BMEatery. \nMy 4 star rating that I posted on google is now docked to a 3.5 (but I will round to 4)- had the combo banh mi again today, but also tried the marinated pork to see how their version tastes. It was so sweet that I actually dribbled fish sauce on the pork every 2-3 bites to balance out the sweetness. I could mostly only taste the sugar, and a tiny bit of lemongrass when I bit into a minced piece. Would not recommend the marinated pork for this reason, and also would hesitate further due to the small amount, because the pork didn't appear until several bites of just bread+pickled carrots+radish. \nI noticed that this time they used non-English cucumbers, and all 3 of our sandwiches only had one piece of cucumber about 4 inches long and about 1/2 inch wide :(",

Good meats, fresh toppings, daikon, jalapeno, cilantro..just tons of flavor.\n\nSmall menu, Sandwiches are $6, sides are a few bucks. Several tea-like drinks on menu. \n\nThe restaurant is on 4th st away from downtown. Pretty odd place for a restaurant like this. Clean and trendy and bright on the inside. Parking lot is terrible so park on the street if you can...or back in. Otherwise you could be waiting a while to get out of the lot.",

It was nice to sit down to a hot, well made full service meal on a campus full of student food choices. \nI had the Italian special, which was their daily special today. The pasta was well cooked, slightly on the bland side but once I salted it m, it was great. There were a lot of pieces of shrimp and plenty of fresh spinach in the bowl. The serving was a good size and also came with two mini cannoli. The cannoli was the highlight of the meal. Delicious cream, not too sweet loaded with chocolate chips and the perfect size. \nService was also good, it's nice to be waited on instead of doing a cafeteria style meal. I'd recommend this restaurant if you're looking for a \"better\" meal at Purdue.",

As a west coast guy, I frequented Rubio's (known for their fish tacos) fairly often. Rusty's fish tacos pale in comparison. Although Rusty's uses cod, the portions look like fish sticks. They are served with a pinch of red cabbage and a bunch of cilantro - the portioning should be opposite. \n\nFor the price, it's difficult to justify coming here more than once a month (although Rusty's would be a good starting point for a night out with friends).",

      "text": "Visit 11/7/2020\nOverall 1.7\n\nKeep looking for good breakfast tacos in this town but haven't found any yet. I tried Rusty's after seeing a flyer at a friends house. My critique is based on 20+ years having lived in Texas. Rusty's is TexMex by claim only. The ambiance is a nice little store front with patio seating. \n\nI over ordered so I could sample several. I also ordered chips and Queso. \n\nChips were nice thick warm and crunchy; queso was a tad watery but thickened as it cooled slightly, onions and tomatoes in it were good.\n\nBacon, Potato, Egg & cheese. Burnt bacon, clumpy precooked scrambled eggs with no flavor on their own. Potatoes were soggy little squares of chewy flavorless bits. The shredded cheese was unmelted and the taco served without enough heat to melt it. Flour tortilla was decent but cold, seemed homemade but most likely just cooked to order pre made rounds. \n\nBrisket, egg and cheese taco & Chorizo- the same can be said as previously on all parts. The brisket was barely noticeable but had decent flavor added to the taco. The chorizo was burnt as well and very dry. \n\nThe green and red salsa were both very good. That added some moisture to otherwise dry tacos. My favorite was the red, it had a Smokey essence. \n\nI will continue searching for a taqueria that serves breakfast.",

There were three of us with three tacos each - none labeled. I'll probably not be back. Lots of other quick joints that are delicious.",

      "text": "This new restaurant is a welcome addition to the southside. It is essentially a fast food restaurant. You order your food at the counter, and your name is called to pick up your food at the counter. You clear your own table. The very definition of fast food. However, this is not Taco Bell. There is a nice list of specialty tacos offered along with optional toppings like guac or sour cream. The tacos are served on a white corn tortilla, not a flour tortilla. I had the brisket taco and the signature Rusty Taco. The brisket was nice and tender. The Rusty Taco has pineapple chunks that provide a sweet flavor. I do feel that the fillings are a bit skimpy for a $2.50-$3.75 taco. Carrie got Tex Mex taco which is your basic ground beef taco. She wished she had ordered the extra sour cream. We got the large queso and chips to share, but we got one small boat of chips that were no where near enough to finish off the large container of queso. We used only half the queso, so I think we got shorted on chips. The staff are very friendly, and the food comes out fast. There is indoor and outdoor seating, and the outdoor seating has direct access to the bar serving beer and wine. Overall, a nice experience.",

      "text": "It's pretty hard to rate Arni's because I like to rate relative to the area, and there really isn't that many great pizza places around (arnies would get a 3 star in most cities). That being said, the staff and workers are very nice people, and the pizza gets the job done as well.\n\nWhat you get here is either bar pizza if you're from the east coast or tavern style if you're from the Chicago area meaning it's thin crust, crisp bottom, and won't take away stomach room from drinks.\n\nThe pizza itself is pretty good depending on what you get for toppings. I haven't had many of their specialty pies, but you get the most bang for ypur buck with sausage or ham. They use crumbled sausage and literally spread it edge to edge which makes it delicious if that's the heartiness you're going for. Value is where this place gets a minus because a large 3 topping pizza is ~$18 which is a little steep in central Indiana for a tavern style especially if you go with veggie toppings.",

      "text": "Loved this pizza spot near Purdue! It may not look like much (totally reminded me of an IHOP layout), but the pizza was incredible. Very similar to a Pizza King style with it being thin crust with sweet sauce and diced up toppings. I was very, very pleased! Pricing was reasonable and obviously with any pizza - an easy meal to share. My pizza choice was of course pepperoni, but they had a good variety of other options. Give em' a whirl. \n\nIt's located in a strip mall type set up and I was honestly a little thrown off when I attempted to find it for the first time. I probably just came in the back way - who knows. I'm not from around those parts. :) But! I'll be back. This was the perfect \"visit Purdue and take your brother out to eat\" spot.",

      "text": "Joe's Pancake House recently opened in the former Great Wall location, next to Hardees. I have noticed the parking lot of this breakfast and lunch place has been crowded. On the weekends, groups of people gather by the front door greeting each other. \n\nThis morning I had some spare time so I decided to check it out. The interior is clean and bright; it appears they didn't have to do much remodeling after the previous tenant (another Chinese restaurant), even leaving a large Chinese framed print hanging in the wait station. The menu is pretty extensive, with the usual breakfast offerings including pancakes with various toppings, burgers and sandwiches (including a Monte Christo), salads, and desserts. The pricing appears to be comparable to the area, along with a seniors and childrens menu.\n\nThe dining room was pretty crowded with customers; servers were circulating topping off coffee and drinks. I ordered my usual breakfast, corned beef hash and eggs (this time sunny-side up). The menu states the corned beef hash is made in-house, and had a nice flavor. The hash browns were the way I make them at home, with par-boiled potatoes. Overall, a tasty meal. \n\nMy only criticism would be the pancake selection. Why call yourself a pancake house without adding some things like a Dutch baby, crepes, aebleskivers, etc?",

      "text": "This is actually my first review on Yelp and mind you, I'm honestly hoping this will end up turning into positive feedback for the owners because we are huge supporters of small businesses and restaurants.  Let's start with the good....location is nice since it's close to my home, we were greeted immediately and sat at a comfortable table that sat all 5 of us adults nicely. Our waitress greeted us and took our beverage order promptly.  The restaurant was quite clean and well lit. I liked that I could see into the kitchen and noted how clean it was as well. Well.....I admit, that's where the good ended. I ordered a sweet tea, I'm sure by pure accident was given unsweetened but it was corrected. Then the sweet 'tea' came.....I got not even a hint of tea...just slightly sugary water. Maybe let it steep longer? I ordered a spinach and feta omelet and while it appeared sizable, it was nearly inedible. The spinach appeared to be either frozen or canned and mixed in with the eggs. When I opened it up, I was given 4 sad little crumbles of feta....neither the spinach nor feta had ANY flavor. My omelet was cooked to a brown....most closely resembling the brown paper towels from a restroom. Ok, so I thought let's try my hashbrowns...even tho I originally ordered American fries....the top was pure potatoe white while the bottom was black....not cooked to a nice crisp, just burnt. My son in law ordered the short stack and waited thru nearly 1/2 the meal before any syrup arrived at the table...3 of the 5 had pancakes as part or all of their meal. (In the meantime a poor guy next to us was left to eat his steak and potatoes with a steak knife because he was never brought actual silverware) My husband tried the taco skillet. The salsa legit looked and tasted like they opened up a can of stewed tomatoes with onions. Chunks were too big and the liquid was tomato water. The meat for his taco skillet was clumpy and tasted like they forgot it overnight in the crockpot on high. Last but not least....the pancakes. Ohhhh the pancakes!! Flat, dense, flavorless, and rubbery. For a pancake house I expected so so much more from the pancakes. They wouldn't even absorb any of the syrup. It seemed as tho ALL of our food was overcooked to a point I have never witnessed. I want this place to succeed. I do....but true success can only come with honest feedback. I'm hoping to try this place another time with a better experience and I'm hoping the owners take time and listen to their reviews.....believe me, my father in law owned and ran a restaurant for 7 years...never wanted to listen to critics, only wanted to listen to his \"friends\" who raved about his food....just cause he was a nice guy and wanted to spare his feelings.",

That shows a lot about a restaurant considering most places could care less (especially about food allergies).\n\nI did go in a few weeks ago and the bartender that normally fills my to-go orders is very nice. The waitress we had sucked. Waited 20 minutes for a water. It took her forever to do anything. It was a Sunday afternoon so maybe she was hungover from the night before? Who knows? The other waitresses seemed very attentive to their tables though!\n\nThis place really has made a turn around in my opinion.

They have the new Impossible Burger (amazing by the way!) plus vegan cheese and mayo and additional vegan dressings. They also have Gardein chikn tacos with avocado and vegan rice and beans. Those are the two dishes we order all the time! Apparently they have some other vegan options, but we always get the same things when we go :)\n\nThe staff are very nice and know what options there are for veggies..and they don't make you feel like you're totally weird for not eating meat in Indiana! We've even had the owner stop by to chat, and he was so nice. It's definitely a great community atmosphere and good prices.",

I particularly like the variety of foods to choose from including Mexican-influenced, burgers and fries, wraps, and other house favorites. I enjoy the way they season their fries. They've also got house made potato chips which are very tasty. I've always had extremely friendly service and the speed of service is great. I go here pretty regularly for lunch. I feel like the portion sizes are just right for the amount that you pay. One of my favorite things they do is provide a to-go soft drink refill to send you on your way after you've paid your bill. I wish more casual sit-down restaurants would do this. I do not drink alcohol, so I can't necessarily speak to drink selection.",

The staff is exceptionally friendly and they always go out of their way to make sure that you have everything you need. \n\nRecently I have been using their pick up service more than anything and the quality is still just as good. Call it in and it's ready 15-20 minutes later at the most. The only real challengers I've experienced recently is the phone line is often busy so it requires multiple calls. I suppose that speaks to their popularity though. \n\nIf you're on the south side of town and need a big lunch for a low price, you're really not going to find a better place. I'd suggest the al pastor burrito covered in queso... it will feed a family of 4 (not really, but you get my point).",

These guys don't have a lot of options in this department either, but they have a fish taco, shrimp taco and a vegetarian (eggplant) taco. The seafood taco's were really good, but nothing to write home about. However, the veg taco was delicious; seasoned beautifully and a scrumptious eat. We were very pleasantly surprised. \n\nThey do curbside which is what we opted for. The restaurant itself was kind of crowded (Saturday afternoon) and not many of the patrons had face coverings. I can't say for certain that social distancing was in place (it didn't look like it?).\nAll the employees had masks on and hand sanitizer was available at the entrance. The ladies restroom is not in great shape - the doors of both stalls had non-functioning locks and I had to use the bin to prop the door closed. \n\nWould I go back? Yes - for the veg taco's, but we will most likely stick to curbside pickup for the foreseeable future.",

Even after waiting a while (delivery did not knock and just left at door, so I did not know they had arrived) it was still fresh and tasty! \n\nThe tostada was delicious! Still crisp after sitting. Chicken was diced, which was not what I expected, but it was good. Toppings were tasty and so were the beans. I ordered a ground beef taco and added lettuce, tomatoes and cheese. Very stuffed and still crispy, not at all soggy. Tasty addition to the meal. \n\nLast, I had to order real tacos. Corn tortillas (doubled) with steak and one carnitas. I got red and green sauce. Both sauces are spicy, delicious, and fresh. Lime is a must! I have not had the steak yet- way too full, but the carnitas were plentiful and on point. Happy with this place and I will order again! Pleasantly surprised.",

The staff is friendly! \n\nIt's been a hit or miss with the steak taco salad. I had it once and it was really good and on a different occasion it was filled with old lettuce and barely any meat. The steak tacos are good. They overload the tacos with meat. You can use the second tortilla and make another taco out of what they give you! The steak was seasoned well and there was plenty of onions and cilantro just how I like it! I've also had the steak torta. The bread could be better. It's kind of chewy, but other than that it's above average. \n\nOverall this is a pretty decent place and it's convenient in a good location, so that's why I'd rate it pretty high. If I wanted better Mexican food and I had time to sit down, I'd probably visit a different restaurant to be honest.",

Prices were fair. \n\nMy wife got the combination plate- 9.99 for three items- chicken taco for Our youngest- which was large and full of meat. An al pastor taco, which was wonderfully seasoned and cooked properly (not dry or burned) A slightly unique flavor and delicious. She also got a Sope which was also good. beans were flavorful, rice was not dry. \n\nI got the Molcajete which was amazing. A giant bubbling lava stone full of delight. It included Shrimp, Chicken, Steak, Roasted Pork, Chorizo, Nopales, avocado, grilled onions and jalapeño, and a couple big chunks of cheese in a rich, savory, slightly spicy sauce. It was topped with fresh onions, cilantro and more cheese. It came with some tortillas on the side and was $15.99. Which felt like a bargain based on the amount and quality of the food. \n\nAlso hot sauces that came with the food were wonderful. \n\nWe highly recommend Senior Tacos.",

I think it opened quite recently because I hadn't even heard of it until I was browsing Door Dash looking to spend some credits and it popped up as a place that offered delivery to my house. We tried it tonight and it was SO good, by far the best Indian food I've had in the Lafayette area so far (which is a very low bar, but still). I had the butter chicken, which is my favorite Indian dish, and it was perfection. Not overwhelmingly spicy, but very flavorful; very creamy and rich without tasting like tomato sauce mixed with heavy cream. I also had paratha bread and it was great. Prices were quite reasonable ($12 for curries that come with rice). They have a lunch buffet and we look forward to visiting the restaurant in person for that.",

      "text": "This is the second time I've been here, first for dinner and second for the lunch buffet. \n\nDINNER: I ordered a lamb curry with a spicy level of 3 out of 6 (assuming halfway was a medium spice, I was wrong). My first bite was exquisite, but oh my goodness was it extremely spicy. I was sweating and sniffling, but kept on eating because it was so flavorful. My friend got a biryani dish with a 1 level spice. I didn't think it was as good as my lamb curry, but it was probably due to my adjusted spice taste. \n\nLUNCH: The buffet is the biggest bang for your buck Indian deal around the area. There's a lot of variety, but lacks the premium dishes (ex. Lamb curry) for obvious reasons. They do a good job of keeping everything in stock and the buffet line clean (unlike other buffet places). Their butter chicken and mango lassi are definitely worth trying. \n\nSERVICE: Absolutely phenomenal. For both meals, we were seated almost immediately. For dinner, we had about 2-3 servers serving us and it felt like we were kings. The food came for me and my friend at almost exactly the same time. They checked on us frequently. For lunch, the same quality of service is expected, but might be less attentive due to the more customers and you can't blame them. \n\nAMBIENCE: Music is great. Lighting is great at night. Everything is very clean as well. \n\nOne note to the owner is the table we sat at for lunch was somewhat wobbly. Didn't mind it at all, but might be an issue for others?\n\nHighly recommended.",

Sunday right about noon time no one else in the establishment customer-wise. None while we dined and none while leaving. Too bad since everything about this place gets a thumbs up from me. I'm not a fan of curry and therefore tend to not seek out Indian food to begin with but I also know there's more to Indiana menus than curry. I got the lamb rogan josh which is made with a yogurt-based sauce. I went with three other individuals and everyone got something different and none of those dishes were curry either. We also got the garlic naan. We all tried each other's food and we all liked all of them two others thought the rogan josh was their second favorite. I know one of the others was butter chicken. The waiter was so nice and kept my water glass full, which is saying something since I drink a lot while I eat. He thanked us about ten times between his last service and us leaving. I still don't consider myself a \"fan\" of Indian food, but I'd happily eat there again.",

      "text": "This was my second visit to Taste of India but today I opted for the buffet menu and I have to say I was impressed. It is $10 if you pay cash and $11 if you pay via card. For an unlimited buffet with starters, the main course, dessert and drinks, I think it is one of the best deals on Indian food that you can get in the Greater Lafayette area. \nThe owner reached out to me personally after my first review and explained that they were short-handed as they had just opened and told me that he had employed more help and today I was able to witness exactly that. We were seated as soon as we walked in and given a table that we selected.\nThe whole spread is very comparable to Sharma's Kitchen and at half the price, it is a deal that I cannot pass upon. Some of the food I ate at the buffet today included aloo tikki chaat, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, chicken pakodas, gajar ka halwa, kheer and mango lassi. They had several vegetarian options as well but as an avid meat lover, it was a hard pass for me. I would give the food a 4.5/5 as it was very delicious but I would have loved it if the Naan's were made to order so that they arrived warm instead of sitting out getting cold.\nThe ambiance of the place get a 5/5 as they have redone the interiors from what India Mahal used to have and it looks better and newer than before.\nAnd finally, the service a 5/5 as they were much more focused on the people inside the restaurant than only giving online orders a priority.\nI will be back for the buffet surely but I am also willing to give à la carte a second chance now that they are staffed well.",

      "text": "best noodles & company branch ever! been coming here since a month ago. \nToday I ordered from their app and used my BOGO rewards (get one free small entree with an order of a small entree)--or so I thought. I rechecked the app twice to see if I applied my rewards, and they all checked up. However, when I got home and opened the paper bag, there was only one plate. After I finished eating, I went back to N&C to see what went wrong. Turns out, the reward didn't come through... \nThey checked the system and it said that I can't claim the reward then... \nbut they gave me a free small entree nonetheless! that's not all, they gave me extra protein!!! (the BOGO reward didn't come with protein.) Make this branch your regular!!! they deserve it.",

      "text": "Really great place to drop by if you're hungry, in the area,  and need it quick. My most important advice for Noodles & Company? To-go portions are always smaller. If you need to go, order it for there, wait a bit, THEN ask for a takeout box. Also, potstickers always seem to be running out (or I'm just supremely unlucky). If they're available, get them. They could be a meal all on their own.\n\nOverall, they serve really good noodles, have plenty of seating (including an outdoor patio for nicer days and booths), and is close to school. Well, being in the Chauncey area, they just have a really good spot. I also found it convenient that you could move around the tables yourself. It certainly works for when there's bigger groups around. \n\nThe main factor that contributes to whether or not you would like the flavor, because the flavor profile does lean towards heavily westernized. Because while I love their Japanese Pan Noodles, the Thai Green Curry with Shrimp, Pad Thai, and potstickers, I'll also be the first to admit that it leans more towards hot-spicy and salty than spices-spicy. However, the fact that they venture into as many different cultural flavors as they could (American, Russian, Japanese, Thai, Mexican, French, etc.) and have a steady flow of new things to try, always makes it interesting.\n\nOrder and pay at the cash register, remember to ask for a cup for water there if you need it, and claim a seat for yourself. The booths and the tables along the wall next to those booths have access to sockets if you want to charge your phone or work. Additionally, I found the two sets of doors you have to go through to get in to be very convenient in the winter when you need to shake the snow off your boots and clothes. SUPER casual, opens late, and (let's face it) is mostly a college student hangout. So, you know, lots of noise during the busier hours of the day.\n\nEDIT: Forgot to mention, this place is one of the last resorts of all last resorts for special occasions and/or guests short of McDonald's. A lot of the time, people will take speakers or guests (family or business-oriented) to Triple X or Basil Thai if they're looking for a casual dining experience. This is especially true for when Maru Sushi, which is a few doors down, gets really backed up and the hangries drive people to the next nearest place to eat. However, from experience, it WILL get pretty crowded around graduation or holidays. And during the Superbowl, finals, and midterms they get really busy. The upside is that, if you can't find a suitable place to feed your visiting family during the busier times and you didn't make any reservations? Noodle & Company will definitely have something available, even if it's only take-away.",

      "text": "Stopped in for lunch with my four year old. She's a fried rice/egg roll kind of girl. We got egg rolls, General Tso, Pork with mixed vegetables and both white and fried rice.\n\nWe planned to eat in, and were lucky there was a table. They only have three tables. Tables are nice, though. There is no table service, so expect to eat a to-go meal on site - plastic utensils, no plates, etc.\n\nFood took maybe 15 minutes during lunch rush. Not bad. \n\nStart with the good - egg rolls came hot and were pretty good. 4/5 on that item. The mixed vegetables in the pork dish were firm, but cooked. I enjoyed those. The pork and the sauce in that dish was pretty bad. Pork was all red like at some Chinese places. I don't know why, and it was so so so sweet. Crazy sweet. If I ordered \"Honey Pork\" I would expect super sweet. I ordered \"Pork w/ mixed veg\". Not great.\n\nGeneral Tso was very bready. Sometimes it's like that. Also very very sweet. No spice at all. Bummer. I don't like sweet Tso. Not a ton of broccoli with it either.\n\nFried rice was pretty weird. It was very yellow rice with a few onions and peas mixed in. Not what I expect when I get fried rice. It tasted ok - a little plain. But just not what I wanted.\n\nOn the whole, the service was good, interior was very clean for a Chinese takeout, egg rolls pretty good, everything else meh. If you're not too picky about Chinese places, you may like this one, so don't let my review sway you to not try it. Just didn't work for me.",

I remember smiling and apologizing for taking awhile to place an order, but she looked at me for a few seconds before turning away.\n\nI hoped the food would make up for the lack of personality in this restaurant. Sadly, the beef and broccoli lacked a depth of flavor and was overall bland and unimpressive. The orange chicken was a little better if you were looking to eat ridiculously sweet orange peel slices disguised as pieces of chicken. As for the egg roll - dry and inedible. \n\nOne plus was the cashier's younger sister (I'm assuming). She handed us our food and had a nice bubbly personality.",

Menu isn't too big or offering anything all original (like that overly posh CoreLife) but it is familiar and gives fun additions few places offer like Buffalo Chicken and blue cheese. The app is smart - integrating gift cards and mobile payments. Starbucks leads mobile ordering (annoyingly! wish Starbucks would stop hiding hoards of cash off shore to avoid taxes!) and great to see others catching up. Our group of 5 was treated well and did subs and some various small dishes. I had a salad with extra Franks cuz some green and good kick goes a long way for me! The manager was super cool with my dumb gift card not wanting to work (felt bad about that!! guess older gift cards should be left alone). My Uptown salad came out like the photos look! Very surprised at this, everyone seemed happy and will have to come back. Have since been back three times! Salads continue to win big for me tho chili isn't near as tasty or rich as Firehouse.

Visiting Purdue, everyone only talks about Mad Mushroom: it's a staple of sorts, you see, just like Pizza X breadsticks at IU. \n\nI first had them 5 years ago during a cursory Purdue visit, followed up by a visit the following year where we ordered a potato pizza that we couldn't stop raving about.\n\nWhen I went back to campus, after my first stop at The Den for my signature Den Pop, we headed to Mad Mushroom. The vibe? Stoner. The scent? Unbelievable. The food? Don't even GET me started.\n\nMost places do cheesestix nowadays- heck, Papa Johns is famous for 'em! But there's something about Mad Mushroom stix that are unique. Perhaps that's just the emotional side of me but hey, it is what it is. They're consistently cheesy without being overwhelming or greasy, and the ranch dipping sauce provided is the perfect accompaniment, although the cheese sauce is a crowd favorite as well. \n\nI don't think I'll ever be able to visit Purdue without a stop at Mad Mush for some classic cheesestix.",

Their price per additional topping is also much steeper than I expected, I just ordered a few other toppings and it added up to $15. I remember enjoying the taste of their four cheese pizza a lot, so I was very excited. This excitement unfortunately soon dissipated when we received the pizza. \n\nThe crust was completely limp, and there were only sprinklings of toppings sparsely scattered throughout the pie. When we spoke to the manager, he said he was sorry but the toppings are measured and that is how their pizzas are made. I felt as if they were deliberately skimping to maximize profits and cut quality. It looked as if although we ordered black and green olives there were maybe 10 olives on the whole pizza. We definitely ordered tomatoes, and we saw maybe five or six small pieces of tomato as well. With the mushroom topping, I maybe saw only a couple of mushrooms on the whole thing. It was also not cooked well, as it could not even be held because the crust was so limp. I was eagerly looking forward to this, but now unfortunately I must say I am unlikely to return. For a $15 pizza, that was a total rip-off.",

We got confirmation that our pickup time was 5:30. We showed up at 5:20 just to be sure we got good hot food. They told us they were a \"running little\" behind when we arrived. I didn't get my food until 6:45. (2 Gyros and 2 shawarma shouldn't take more than a few minutes each to make.) I watched people walk up, confused by the lack of a menu on the truck, be told they couldn't order at the window (BTW, what food truck can't take orders right at the window?), had to order using a website, and still get their food before I did. When we did finally receive our food, the shawarma was bland. The hummus had a very thin consistency and was without much flavor. The gyros were passable, but I've had better in town. \n\nAll in all it was a not only disappointing experience, it was an angering expedition at having to wait well over an hour for food that shouldn't have taken more than 10 min to prepare.",

They only do take-outs and deliveries and are in the process of establishing their kitchen. \n\nThe owner and staff are very friendly and provided us with great service whilst chatting about their new establishment. \n\nThey have a lot of vegan options (hummus, falafel, tabouleh etc) and sandwiches/shawarmas. Whilst waiting for our order, we got to try some of their falafel (complimentary!) which was really delicious and crisp to the touch. The tahini sauce accompaniment was okay, I personally felt the Tahini flavor was a little too overwhelming and may require other flavors/sauces to bring it more into balance. \n\nTo go, we got the Beef (steak) shawarma. This came in a paper box (which I really appreciated, rather than a foam/plastic container). The shawarma was pre-made and then toasted as they are still in the process of setting up their full kitchen. I'm a huge shawarma fan and it is almost always my go-to item when I'm at a Middle Eastern place. I'd have to say their steak shawarma wasn't quite what I hoped but does have the makings of a great shawarma. The beef has good seasoning but could use with some more, and although there were little bits of pickled vegetables in the shawarma, it gets drowned in all the meat. The shawarma was pre-made, and because it was heated up on one of those sandwich toasters, it really flattens out the wrap when technically it should be full and juicy. It came with Tahini sauce on the side & a coleslaw like salad with potato chips.\n\nPrices are very reasonable for take-outs and delivery. \n\nWould I go back? Yes. I'd like to give their shawarmas another go and see how they come along as they establish themselves.",

My brother decided to get the chicken pot pie (southern Ohio boy always) and his friend wanted the chicken strips. While not fancy, a good variety to see how the food was. \n\nWhen I picked up the food 25 minutes later, everything was there and the system for pick up was smooth. Got to see the huge fish tank in the wall so I almost wished we felt like eating in. \n\nMy brother and I got the southern style green beans ,made with baconfat. Betty Sue got fries and slaw. We also honey butter croissants with our meal.  All of us agree that everything was some of the best we ever had. The pot pie was huge. \n\nThe Monte Christo was so good it that I wanted to eat it all in one sitting, but at 1440 calories, I saved half for breakfast. The raspberry sauce was perfect with the melted cheese, ham, turkey, and bread deep fried in light batter.\n\nIt was even just as good microwaved the next morning. So was the honey butter croissant. I even looked up to see if they had a location in Michigan. This is my last trip to Lafayette but if I have to come back, I would have a meal here.\n\nI took a star off for the VERY small take out pop and ice tea.",

Our server wore hers below her nose. She was professional and friendly. When she greeted our table she apologized for the mess on the floor and later came and cleaned it up. The dining room was quite disheveled for the beginning of a dinner shift. The crescent rolls are great! We had chips and cheese with salsa. The cheese had a bit of a congealed layer on top but was good. I ordered the salmon and broccoli. The fish was prepared well with good seasoning. Broccoli was steamed with a good crunch. Overall pleasant experience just need to do better on housekeeping and cleaning throughout the shift.",

      "text": "Not sure why the low ratings, seems the Yelp tendency to get overly dramatic with minor issues holds an unfair cloud over this great place. Have been here three times with different people, each time a good variety of the menu ordered, tasty drinks and food - ended up happy we picked this spot! I'm guessing there might be a problem with some overwhelmed by the (pre-social distancing) massive menu. But in a twist, the current paper-limited menu offers an easy and streamlined way to figure out what to get. I've sampled quite a bit and found nothing wrong with anything so far! Check out my photos, I love the ribs here. Very soft and rich, some of the best in the city! My friend gets the chicken tenders every time he visits a Cheddar's - myself and another both agreed the Monte Cristo is a work of genius. I'm personally happy to see a proper cocktail (the Painkiller) given a decent mix up. It doesn't seem to be perfected with fresh squeezed juices but it goes down real well and has been well balanced both times I got it. This is a refreshing classic chain restaurant without the obnoxious prices of Red Lobster/Longhorn or the iffy consistency of TGI/Olive Garden.",

Cheddar's was sold to the parent company of Olive Garden last year, so perhaps that has something to do with it.\n\nThere's lots to like about Cheddar's: the ingredients are fresh and, when they say that their menu is \"from scratch\", I'm inclined to believe them. The decor and atmosphere are very nice - the big paddle fans and the wall-sized fish tank are nice touches. The service has been consistently great.\n\nOn the down side, the beer list, which used to be quite good, and which included several nice local microbrews, has been dumbed down to the point of being truly ignorable. The ribs, which were great on our first visit, were dry and uninteresting this time. I remembered the coleslaw being really good on our first visit, but decidedly \"meh\" this time around. We were there with a party of five adults, and all ordered different foods. There wasn't really anything on the order that made anyone go \"Wow, this is good!\"\n\nAnother small nit to pick. We were there for a birthday, and mentioned it to both the waitress and the hostess.

Hardworking staff and fresh food, but I'm just not a fan of the smallish portion sizes. The sandwich tasted good but was about six bites. I'm not sure if that assessment is a reflection of the size of my mouth or the size of the sandwich. The chips now come in even smaller bags (1.0 ounce), next step they will be the size of soup cracker pouches. A skinny pickle spear rounded out the entree.\n\nFour stars for helpful staff and freshness. Two stars for value. Overall three stars.",

I've not braved the parallel parking spots along State Street, but it is an option. There is also a parking garage behind the hotel, and it's a few minutes walk to Panera.

      "text": "Haven't had a bad meal here and staff is always friendly. However it's no secret that value is far from Panera Bread's mind. Portion sizes are smaller and less filling than 5 Guys, Panda Express, Moe's, Green Leaf, and Lotsa just to name a few in the close vicinity. Also this location seems nice but there's a lack of open parking spaces during busy weekends. It's a large and well designed place and accommodates small and large groups. Outside seating is great for the summer. Sandwiches and soups are the typical Panera: super excessively salty and expensive but no other fast casual place I know does salads this good - good at helping forget you just dropped $8.50 on some bunny fare. For healthier non-salad food at this price point I highly recommend Town & Gown Bistro just down on River Rd does some amazing pasta, burgers, and breakfast foods, similar prices and way higher quality. If sit-down takes too long, go right up Chauncy for Qdoba, Captian Gyros, 5 Guys, Panda Express, or AJ's - all offer a lot more food for the price. Panera is a weird mix of pretend health (those sandwiches have way too much sodium for real nutrition types) and high prices. I keep hoping they get their act together and stop shipping in the soup from St Louis and offer real ingredients really worth 50% more than Wendys.",

Food poisoning aside (yes, really), I feel the need to point out one specific incident. \n\nWhile waiting in line with our large group, the manager opened up a second register. In line was a group of teenagers and a middle-aged man who apparently have not been to Panera enough times to know what they wanted. They briefly left the register to go look at the menu (irritatingly located towards the back of the restaurant). In the meantime, a woman in her 80s walks straight up to register now without a line, and the manager couldn't have been more rude. \"Ma'am, MA'AM, do you not see those people over there?? You need to WAIT. HELLOOO LOOK OVER THERE. PLEASE WAIT\". She didn't say a thing just simply stepped up to the open register. \n\nI understand our large group can be stressful, but never in our experiences with nearly 50 different Paneras across the country (I'm not kidding) have we ever experienced a manager so rude and overwhelmed. \n\nWe brought the woman over to our line to get her away from him because she was clearly upset. In fact, she was able to get through our line quicker since the manager clearly lacks competence in more areas than customer service. \n\nBetween missing food in to-go orders, food poisoning, and terrible customer service we will never support this Panera again. There are several other options in West Lafayette for lunch and large groups.",

      "text": "Panera has pretty good food!  They specialize in fresh baked goods including bagels, breads, pastries, and other sweet breads.  Panera also has great soups, salads, and sandwiches. \n\nThe upside: QUALITY - I feel like Panera is a step above other fast food restaurants in terms of food quality.  The ingredients aren't frozen and full of preservatives.  I love the fuji apple chicken salad and french onion soup!  EFFICIENCY - another impressive thing about Panera is the efficiency with which they handle customers.  I've seen lines of customers extending nearly out the door during peak hours, yet the wait time remains relatively short.  \n\nThe downside:  PRICE - Panera is twice as expensive as other fast food places.  PARKING - the parking is a nightmare.  I can't stress this enough - you literally cant find a parking spot during lunch hours.  Several other businesses located in the same shopping plaza are vacant and I strongly suspect that's due to the lack of parking.  \n\nOverall, I like Panera!  It fills a niche that exists somewhere between fast-food and sit-down dining by providing freshly made soups, salads, and sandwiches made to order at fast pace.  Your experience will be best if you dine before or after the noon rush.",

My favorites are the stuffed burger, boneless wings, and fried mushrooms. Big League Sports Bar and Grill features what I consider the ABSOLUTE BEST lime margarita. Each bartender has their own style, as they do not use a mix. Ask for Mackenzie if you are ready for AWESOME!\n\nBig League Sports Bar and Grill also offers daily specials, such as Taco Tuesdays and White Claw Wednesdays. There are two pool tables and three dart boards and plenty of TVs to keep one busy. 4 of 5 stars due to long service times on burgers, wings, and some apps (they actually cook things here).\n\nWhether you live in Lafayette, or just visiting, Big League Sports Bar and Grill is a definite stop.",

      "text": "Let me preface that I want soooo much to like this place.  I truly do.  It is close to my house and I like the convenience of it.\n\nAgain, greatly disappointed.\n\nFirstly, I preface that they appeared to be very understaffed yesterday.  Two bartenders/servers and maybe one or two cooks.  The bar had an engagement party going on one side and 50% (per the guidelines) of the bar side were full.  Essentially, the restaurant was full, for what they are allowed to be.\n\nPros:  --There are hand written signs on the door advising customers that if they are sick, they should not enter.\n--Upon entering, there is hand sanitizer that you are directed to use before being seated. \n--Prior to being seated, our table was fully cleaned and sanitized from the previous customers\n--the two servers/bartenders were friendly and attentive\n\nTHIS is where the Pros stop.  \n\nCons:  \n--Our server greeted us and gave us our menus and I asked her if the NASCAR Coca Cola 600 could be placed on one of the many TVs.  The best that I could tell, only the Golf Challenge (Tiger/Brady/etc..) was live.  All of the other sports were documentaries or replays (2014 Indy 500).  She said she would check.  20 minutes later we would ask the other server/bartender and he said the same thing.  When we left after an hour of a visit, no channels had been changed. \n--We ordered a pitcher of Mich Ultra and the bartender told us she just emptied the keg and would have to change it.  That was done quickly and our beer was delivered.  Our Ultra looked like a Shandy.  It was cloudy and had a fruity taste to it.  We politely mentioned it to our server/bartender and she agreed it looked cloudy and replaced it with Coors Light with no extra charge.  (our glasses with the bad beer were never cleared from the table and the only reason the pitcher was is because we asked)\n--Food was okay.  Nothing spectacular.\n--The noise level is still difficult to deal with.  With no soft coverings on the walls or ceilings, this place remains one giant echo chamber.  When someone would loudly laugh at the engagement party, it bounced off of multiple walls.  It was difficult to carry on a simple conversation on the other side of the bar.\n--Governor's Covid-19 Guidelines--- Now, I am not a stickler to all of the guidelines and conversations can be had about the legality of them.  That being said, no server/bartender/cook were wearing a face covering, as required.  The bartender/servers had them around their neck and maybe covering their chins, but never across their nose and mouth.  The two workers in the back had no such coverings.\n      Also, there was an individual standing at the bar ordering beers.  Following the guidelines, there are no chairs to sit at the bar, however, this individual spent at least 40 minutes standing at the bar watching TV.  At a minimum this violates the spirit of the guidelines.  \n--there is a hole punched in the drywall above one of the urinals in the Men's room.  There is a handwritten note next to it, in same handwriting as signs on front door and sanitizer station, that uses an explicative and has multiple people writing their own notes.  Obviously the hole has been there a while. \n\nStaffing is always a challenging thing and when understaffed, certain things will fall through the cracks like requesting more ketchup and having to remind the employee 15 minutes later that you still need the ketchup.\n\nI want sooooooo greatly to like this place.  I really do.  I have no allegiance to the owners from any other bars so that is not a factor for me.  I just wanted to come in on a Sunday to the sports bar and enjoy some sports, have a beer, a sandwich and be on my way.  Sadly, this place failed again.",

My waffle Burger was a truly original creation and I loved every ounce of it except the strawberry aioli was weird and not the best mix - I would have preferred a raspberry jam or similar instead. The others all quote about their burgers and made quick work of them. We will definitely be back soon as great burgers for 10 bucks including fries are hard to come by. they Don't charge extra for Fry's which is beyond wonderful! And curly fries are an option which made me want to kiss the waitress.",

Burger was cooked perfect and daughter loved it but the fires were soggy and bland likely from the takeout serving container. The philly started good but it seemed to be loaded with trimmings from a brisket, like fat and small bits, I expected nice slices throughout. The philly maybe had 3 very thin full slices but was tasty just too much cheese sauce. The fried mushrooms batter was very greasy and the fried pickles seemed fried to long. We will try it again in the future.",

Totally ruined our dining experience because it was too loud. Food wasn't as good this time - had the brisket and was very tough. Was expecting thinner slices and tender. Found out they don't have a 3 way license at this time. Men's restroom didn't have paper towels in dispenser or it was malfunctioning (according to husband). I didn't go into the men's restroom.",

      "text": "Echo is a good experience if you're looking for something different to do near Purdue's campus. Despite being such a large campus, your options can be pretty limited on what to do as far as nightlife- when there's no movies out you want to see, when you've already gone out to the bars more nights than you'd like to admit this week, when you've already ate dinner, it can be difficult to find something to do. With Echo, karaoke is now an option! It's a fun place that you can grab a few of your not-easily-embarrassed friends and sing the night away. \n\nThe rooms here are private, so you don't have to worry about having to perform in front of a group of strangers. The rooms feature leather couches, a table, a TV, microphones, and the touch screen karaoke system. The system, once you learn to operate it, has a massive amount of songs available. Hit songs get added fairly frequently, and many feature the music videos, which is a nice touch. Most genres are represented as well. I'm a huge rap fan, and I had no trouble finding rap hits.\n\nEcho also serves food and drinks. Although you can order alcohol, under 21s are still allowed here, so this is a good option if you're with an under 21 crowd. The food is good, and it's nice to be able to order drinks right to your room. \n\nThere are a few drawbacks. First, the pricing here has gotten pretty steep. On the weekend, you can expect to pay a minimum of $8/hour per person, and that's not including any drinks or food. So if you stay for over two hours, you're approaching $20/person. This is very steep considering the prices of other entertainment in the area. When you add in food/drink, your bill can get very expensive. So I would suggest going during the week if you can. It can also get very hot in the rooms due to the equipment, so don't wear too much heavy clothing if you're going here during the winter.\n\nOverall though, Echo is a great option in the West Lafayette area for some late night entertainment. It's a unique offering and one that is very fun for groups.",

      "text": "I have been to Echo before and I think that having a karaoke bar on campus is a great idea, however, this most recent trip may sadly be my last.\n\nA group of six of my friends and I were craving dumplings and had planned to go on Saturday night. Half of us arrived and ordered appetizers and water. When the other half of our group arrived, we discussed what we wanted and ordered.\n\nFirst, the waiter did not bring us enough drinks and could not answer questions about the menu. We finally ordered and when it came to repeat the order back to us, he did it in the most complicated way by totaling all of our orders together instead of by pairs we had ordered so we knew it was correct.\n\nAfter finally sorting out and confirming out order, he returned shortly to say that they did not have the Pork dumplings with chives and eggs, and the members of our group who had ordered them decided to order a different type.\n\nHe then returned again to make a funny joke. He said \"you know the chef in the back already doesn't like me, but now he hates me since your order is so big!\" I was appalled. First of all, we already weren't very happy with his service; second, we are trying to enjoy the company of friends and do not wish to be interrupted for your own personal reasons if it does not pertain to our order; and third, how dare he imply that by bringing this establishment business, we are hurting his work relationship with the chef! If I was the chef, I also would probably not enjoy dealing with this server, since we couldn't stand all of 15 minutes with him.\n\nHe came back again and informed us that they did not have a different type of dumpling, the beef and celery ones, and at this point, we needed a minute to discuss what we were going to do.\n\nWe ended up cancelling our dumpling order and paid for the appetizers which were delicious. I brought the issue up with the manager and apologized for cancelling our order and she apologized for the poor taste in humor from the server. She mentioned that they were changing ownership thus changing some of the menu, and that the server should have notified us in advance that they did not serve this food.\n\nShe was very kind, and the server did apologize. \n\nI would recommend Echo for their food, although if they are changing owners I do not think I can. I was very disappointed, and if you do decide to venture here one night, I hope you can get a more professional server than we did, and that you also can get all that you order.",

And popcorn Chicken, just try it, and you will know what I am talking about. \n\nThe owner of Echo is a really nice guy, just ask him to bring their best thing to you.\n\nNever to worry about the price, the price of everything would make you satisfied. \n\nTo be honest, I think their food is better than most of the Chinese restaurants here. \n\nJust go there and you'll know what I'm talking about.",

      "text": "WHO SINGS THAT SONG? \n\nI do! If you walk in and think Taylor Swift is there, it's just me. Come say hello! Haha.\n\nThis is a place on campus near Scotty's Brewhouse and Neon Cactus. I don't think many people know of it and I have to spread the joy. \n\nWhat is this? A karaoke bar. Yes. Most people close it out thinking, \"I am NOT singing in front of people. No way!\" However, relax my friends. You and your small group of like 1-12 people get their own PRIVATE room. Hooray. There are three microphones in each room. I truly can't tell the difference between the melody mic and two harmony. I feel they are all equal and how loud is each person singing and how close are they holding the mic to their mouth.\n\nNow, it's not public karaoke and private rooms so it must be expensive, right? ...NOPE! Very affordable. The problem is it's so much fun and they are open until 4am the hourly rate adds up. It's only $6.25 a person per hour in your own private room with comfy black leather couches, \"soundproof\" walls (how much can it be in the common area-but zero room to room noise), and tv screen with lyrics, 3 microphones to share or pass, two tv remotes, English and I believe Korean. Once you learn the buttons on one (or both of you can read them) they do the same things. I can use the Non-English one for volume changes at the least if the other is across the table with a friend selecting next song with it.\n\nThe song list here is incredible and thousands without a doubt. There is like EVERYTHING when you search by artist, band, genre, male, female, and even other languages. You can have a whole list of songs in your queue, or with like 5 people pass the remote on to let the next person pick a song while three others are singing. My friends and I take turns. This is in West Lafayette near Purdue. With that being said we celebrate diversity. Boiler up! There is multiple languages and it's legit. I learned I have two friends that can rap in Korean. That was a totally awesome shocking surprise and impressing to me. I love different and talent. I thought I was with like the coolest people there. But, I got them as my friends that night. Hooray! Lucky jackpot. They even queue'd up: Let it Go (Frozen), Wanna Be (Spice Girls), and Love Story (love my Tay Tay -Taylor Swift). They like knew my musical dreams & think I can actually sing or something. Bahaha! \n\nFood/Drink: They do have some food from open until a certain time the kitchen closes. I believe it's Asian Fusion food. The menu doesn't look long & I haven't eaten here personally - but my friends tell me it's quite good. They serve a limited alcohol menu but hey, they have some. It's only sake, and alcohol energy drinks called FOUR. It's mostly for hanging out and singing really. I drink before I come (if drinking that night) and have one there during my hour, which quickly turns into two hours easily. \n\nTip: The first time you visit, your first half hour is free. After that your $6.25 per hour begins. I have never seen someone leave at 30 minutes not having fun (not in my group! Wink!)\n\nTip 2: Be aware of the price adding up if on a tight college budget. The cost is not bad at all (for here or ANY private room place) but for the college kids a couple drinks and two hours can add up at this luxury. It's hard to stop when the employees pop in and say 5 minutes left of your hour. They are not putting you on a cut-off timer... But you have to decide to stay or wrap it up. If you are out five minutes late they won't harass you at all. But be respectable humans so the place doesn't need to place timers on its rooms due to inconsiderate people who could spoil it. Like, you CAN finish your song and one more without being cut off mid song... Wouldn't that suck? No one likes that. Echo likes its customers having fun!\n\nAdditional fun: There are tables for food and board games out front. Also, they HAVE board games here. It's totally free to come play board games with friends here. You can bring the purchased food & drinks in the karaoke rooms if you want, or you can get food and a drink out front. Also, no purchase necessary to chill and play board games really. Seems like regulars and employees do this the most but all are welcome. \n\nI totally give this 5 stars because it is something with a little extra to be on a college campus and here in Lafayette/WestLafayette/Purdue. It's the only one of its kind, and it is SO fun. I never thought my friends and I would be able to afford renting out a private room with entire karaoke set up, couches, and a door for the shy friends who open up here very quickly and join in the fun. I love that it is something totally different than anything I have seen or been to before and I can't lie - I love singing & am aware I am tone deaf. My shower head doesn't judge me though and my friends don't mind and laugh and pee their pants almost sometimes. It's all part of the fun. \n\nI say if you like to sing (not can you, LIKE to), sing your heart out here! Cheers!",

When we asked if they was another way to lookup Korean songs, we were given an old songbook that did not go past 1999. The English selection of songs is okay for pop and RNB but very limited for other genres like rock.",

We toured the place beforehand and asked how late it'd be open, we were told 4 am. So we all hung out and decided we would come back in the early morning hours and check the place out and we were excited it was open so late. Around 2 AM I called just to make sure and was told it'd be open till 4. We arrived a little before 3 hoping to get in a good hour and it was closed. I don't understand why I was repeatedly told 4 AM and never told that they might close sooner. I wouldn't waste your time with a business that lies to customers.",

It was a five star service from the friendly lady who took our order on the phone and brought the food to us to enjoying a good meal at home. The food was ready when we arrived, exactly when they promised. \n.. \nI chose the salmon on greens salad. I always enjoy the way Longhorn chefs prepare salmon. It's moist and not overcooked and dry.  I really liked they way the salmon salad was packaged. The molded tray allowed the salmon was separated from the salad and wrapped in aluminum foil. It was still warm after a 20 minute drive home. The salad greens were still crisp and fresh. \nMy wife had the Seasoned Steakhouse chicken wing appetizer and a bowl of the shrimp & lobster chowder. The wings were cooked perfectly and well seasoned.  The soup was \"delicious\".\nOverall an excellent experience.",

The bartender was pretty nice and quick. He didn't really engage in small talk, but that was fine with me. \n\nFor my meal, I had the sirloin and shrimp combo, which was not too bad. I will say that the steak was super salty; however, the grill shrimp tasted pretty nice. Also, the rice pilaf was really good; I could have had an entire bowl of the pilaf. The starter salad was a bit of a struggle. \n\nThe price of my meal was pretty reasonable . I would return.",

      "text": "First time visiting the new Longhorn Steakhouse in town. \n\nThere was an approximately 30 minute wait so we elected to sit at a high top table in the bar. We walked in and sat down immediately. \n\nThe bar is surprisingly small. For a restaurant attached to a hotel, there are 14 seats at the bar. If i were traveling by myself I would want to sit at the bar and not in the restaurant and it would be tough if the bar is busy.\n\nThe rest of the restaurant is mainly booths with only a few independent tables and one corner table for a larger (6-8) group.  \n\nOur server was prompt and polite. \n\nI ordered a 20oz Yuengling draft that cost $5.49. Not pricey for a chain restaurant near a hotel but pricey for Lafayette. A pint cost $4.49.  \n\nFor food, I passed on an appetizer and went straight to the entree.  I ordered the 11oz Renegade Sirloin, medium well, with the house salad and a plain baked potato plus bacon.  The potato listed in their sides comes \"loaded\", but I don't enjoy that.  \n\nMy wife ordered the parmesan crusted chicken with the salad and mashed potatoes as the sides. \n\nOur food came within 15 minutes and we enjoyed good conversation and the complimentary bread.  \n\nMy steak was cooked just right, although I don't like my potato bathing in a plate full of steak juices. If you like that, this won't be an issue for you.  It was tender and juicy and seasoned to the point where I didn't  need to add any. The potato cake plain with bacon, but not a lot of bacon. I would have liked some more on my potato.  My wife's chicken was cooked right and had a good amount of spices on it. She enjoyed it very much. \n\nOverall, the food was very good. The service was good and the beer was cold. \n\nThe only things I noted were the small bar and the material the bar tables are made of. This is an important thing to think about. It is not a reason to go or to stay away from the restaurant but it is good to know.  The high top tables are made of a composite material and they are \"slick\" on the top. This becomes an issue when you go to cut your steak because your plate will slide as you cut. My wife had to hold my plate. Just a heads up. \n\nOverall, good experience.  Will we go back?  I am sure we will. We are partial to Logan's probably because it is more causal and the beer prices are better.",

Half of the time we'll be waiting while we watch them sit around and talk.  After dealing with the manager, I'm pretty sure I understand why it is the way it is.\n\nOn a recent visit, I decided to order a LH (Long Horn) Burger, because the ribs and steaks have been overcooked the past couple of times.  When I took my first bite, I immediately noticed the burger crumbling.  I ordered it medium, but it was so dry and overcooked that I couldn't eat it.\n\nI'm not one to usually send something back, but the place was practically empty and there was no excuse for such a poorly cooked burger.  (I'm pretty sure that I could make a better burger in the microwave.)\n\nAnyhow, after watching our party finish their food, the manager finally brought me out a replacement. He seemed very smug.    I immediately noticed that it was missing bacon, but didn't say anything because everybody else was done eating and I didn't want them to have to wait another 30 minutes for it to be corrected.\n\nAlso, again the manager didn't care enough to check the ingredients on his business' signature burger before bringing it out.  I can't expect his staff to care anymore than he does. \n\nFor anybody that's visiting the area, I'd recommend Texas Roadhouse over Long Horn every day of the week.  I've been there many times, and I can't remember a single time that I was as displeased as I am with Long Horn.  \n\nGood thing LH has a great location, because I don't know too many people that would go out of their way for Hot Garbage.",

      "text": "Longhorn is my family's favorite restaurant! We've been to the Lafayette location about once or twice per month since it opened, and we've tried every item on the menu (most of the seasonal items too). Everything is good, but there are a few menu items that are truly great:\n\n*Wild West Shrimp\nChili Cheese Fries (small portion)\nFirecracker Chicken Wraps\nLoaded Potato Soup\nFlat Iron Steak, cooked medium rare\n*Boneless Ribeye steak, cooked medium\nFlo's Filet, cooked medium rare\nParmesan Crusted Chicken (way better than it sounds!)\n*Chocolate Stampede\nKey Lime Pie Jar or Chocolate Peanut Butter Jar\n\nIf it's your first time, I recommend trying the starred (*) items. For sides, I recommend the side salad with ranch, and if you like mashed potatoes, ask for brown gravy! We've been impressed with the attitude of all the managers and most of the servers, though as you would expect in food service, there are new faces all the time. Don't trust the review of someone who only went once... listen to the person who's ordered every item on the menu!",

      "text": "Unfortunately our experience was horrible! Waited 45 minutes for two NY strips and kids sirloin...while waiting my salad was brought out, I ended up spitting it out as the cucumbers tasted like some type of chemical was on them. I asked the server for more warm bread...ended up getting a still frozen in the middle loaf...manager even touched it to confirm. Steaks finally come and as I'm cutting my son's up I taste it and cringed from how salty it was...he's 5 so there was no way I was giving that to him! Tasted the other two steaks and both just as salty. We sent them back but I sure wish we hadn't bc my server comes back 10 minutes later to say \"those will be out shortly and I told them NO SEASONINGS\" I said no why did you tell them that? There's a difference from seasoning correctly and over seasoning. Smh\n\nWe come to longhorn bc they're steaks have more flavor than other chain steakhouses. Not here. The new steaks came out bland and medium instead of medium well. We didn't even complain just left more than half the food sitting there.  The baked potato and loaded mashed were both great! The manager did comp one ny strip meal.",

Started off by yelling across the bar (causing most of the customers at the bar to turn and look at us) that we couldn't sit at the table we were sitting at without being seated there! We both said to him that we knew that as the hostess came and gave us our menus. He shook his head and said \"okay then\" in a very rude way.\n\nAs we waited for our waiter, guess who showed up?! The rude bartender...he's our waiter. Ugh! Asked if we had been to a longhorn before. We both said yes. He asked us to be more enthusiastic. I replied in the same tone and said yes. He said, \"really?! That's not enthusiastic!\" \n\nTook forever bringing our waters and food. Most of the time he didn't, it was a food runner or other waiter. Didn't even care that we didn't touch some of the food bc we didn't like it, he just took it and left. \n\nStuffed mushrooms were very rich but good. Tasted like Alfredo sauce and topped with other cheeses.\n\nFrench onion soup was very sweet and not much to it. \n\nMy friends salads looked good and fresh. \n\nMy lobster tail was good but the butter had unneeded spices in it. \n\nTook a bite of my friends steak that she didn't eat bc it was over seasoned and it totally was!!!! One bite and I went to the bathroom to get all of it out of my teeth.\n\nDon't think I'll be returning anytime soon and if I do and I see \"Travis G\" they better keep him as far away from me as possible!\nIf they are smart at all, they would terminate someone who represents their company, yet treats customers like crap!",

Wait staff seemed inexperienced and out of sorts. \nThey actually ran out of baked potatoes at 5PM on a Sunday. I suppose things like that happen sometimes. \nSalads were not brought out all together nor were the entrees, or sides. They just didn't seem to have a handle on what they're doing.\nThe steaks were very greasy, almost like they poured hot oil over them when plating, or dropped them in a fryer to heat them up. Sounds strange but pretty sure that's what it was.\nChicken was good but barely warm, even though it was brought out at least 5 minutes after the other entrees. Pretty sure it sat there cooling off until they found someone to run it to the table.\nI plan to give them another chance, but it may take awhile. Maybe they'll get their act together.",

      "text": "Perfect interstate spot to relax and enjoy a quality atmosphere, attentive and enjoyable staff, and predictable minimalist menu - a few non-steak items but mostly the ripe cuts of choice bovine. Our group enjoyed the budget friendly cuts and largest burger. My spaghetti squash side was a tasty surprise and huge, definitely worth the $2 upgrade. Our waitress was on top of her game. It's a new place and shows it, lots of parking, easy access, and beautifully done interior. I personally am not a franchise steak person. I'd rather spend $15 at Sushi-Don, get a huge slice of pan seared salmon at Town & Gown across the river, or even do a drink and entre at TGI Fridays. My favorite steak of all time was actually cooked by a friend at a church retreat. I've realized this: the perfect steaks are often those cooked up by the random guy who knows his stuff. LongHorn may satisfy the casual cow eater but for me dropping $20+ for a real beef cut is silly. Next time I'll try a burger or be thankful someone else is paying for the steak! LongHorn does have a few perks on its side, rich atmosphere featuring an open and Western inspired ambiance. Excellent staff, and experience sorted out well above the average chain.",

I got the Bar 20 pizza, which is essentially a BBQ Chicken Pizza. Not a big fan of this one; it was slightly over cooked and the chicken pieces were too big. \n\nFinally for dessert, I got a Tiramisu cake and a chocolate torte. Both of those were absolutely delicious and I devoured the cakes haha. The torte was 100% my favorite ever!!\n\nA big plus: the staff was enforcing masks as well as social distancing, yay!",

There is a pickup option if you want to carry out your order as well.

      "text": "Overall: Just like any other Puccini's, this location is the perfect spot for your pizza, calzone, or pasta fix.\n\nThe good: If you've been to other Puccini's in the state, you know what's up. The food is king here - No matter what you get, it's going to be well-portioned, tasty, and fresh. The salads are heaping in size (get the buttermilk ranch) and the pizzas, calzones, and pastas are all great in their own way. I won't go into details, but I've never had a bad meal and it continued at this location as well.\n\nThe not-so-good: If you've never been to a Puccini's before, the atmosphere can be somewhat bland. And, for whatever reason, out of all the Puccini's I've been to (4 between Indy, Bloomington, and here), for whatever reason this one didn't have the same charm.\n\nFood: 8.5/10\nAtmosphere: 7.5/10\nService: 8.5/10",

The bottom was rock hard, the top barely cooked and all I could taste was flour. Complete waste of money. I would eat them if they were free.\n\nThe vodka sauce was so strange I still am not sure how to feel about it. The pasta was over cooked and it was hardly at room temp. There was an awkward sweet flavor to it. Will never try it again. \n\nThe two pizzas we got were pretty good but extremely greasy. Looking at their menu are are other pizzas I am interested in trying. The sauce tasted homemade and they both had a lot of flavor. \n\nThe cheesecake was great except for the crust again it tasted like flour.\n\nThe pizza was worth it but I wouldn't order anything else. I ordered carry out so that might have been a factor.",

A lady answered and was very, very rude to me when I expressed concern that this was now the second time my order was entered/made incorrectly. I informed her I would never do business with her restaurant again. A manager should never speak to a customer like that and she should be fired.

The meat was VERY tough and chewy. It did not have much flavor.  \n\nThey did a good job with the sides. The sweet potato is served with cinnamon butter and a side of brown sugar. The cinnamon butter was all I needed on my sweet potato. The broccoli and carrots were freshly steamed. The loaded baked potato comes with a salted skin.\n\n The onion appetizer was a good size to share among 4 people for the price.  The rolls are AMAZING.  They walk you to your table with a fresh warm basket of rolls and cinnamon butter.  You can request more complimentary rolls.  \n\nWhile you wait there are peanuts to eat and you throw the shells on the floor. They have more peanuts in a tub at your table.  You will not go home hungry here!  \n\nWe did call ahead seating. They lost our name after we arrived and thought we were already seated. This delayed our seating by 15 minutes from the originally quoted time. \n\nIf I return, I would not order prime rib and try another dish.",

I typically enjoy the rotisserie chicken here with a side of veggies and salad. While everything here was delicious, I think they may have changed up how they serve the chicken.

At first the waitress were nice to us when she took the drink order. After I politely asked her to get someone to clean the peanut shells, she immediately made a rude face and since then the attitude has gone far off. We even observed as she served other tables and she was nice all along. I cannot tolerate such attitude difference when I came here for an at least okay dining experience. She did eventually clean the peanut shells though. She might have mistaken that we threw those shells on the ground but thats not a reason for rudeness. I would praise the food but sadly theres no separate rating.",

Immediately the waitress came over realizing she never entered our meal.  She brought our chili over.... it was severely over cooked.  The meat was rubbery.\n\nOur food arrived, steak was undercooked.  My husband ordered an unsweetened tea and was served a sweet tea.  We were unable to find a server to fix the mistake.  I walked up to the one person around, a hostess walking around looking for empty tables.  I asked for her help and her response was \"I am not taking your tea.\"\n\nIn response, the manager showed up with a free appetizer and discounted one meal.  No need for the free appetizer, we won't be back.",

      "text": "This is the budget dining spot for the day's dose of sodium in one massive overload of an entree! Fantastic service even with our poor waitress having to put up with some major immature baby adults near us - what a solider, she treated us so well despite the battle she couldn't win. We five enjoyed all our foods from steak cutlets to chicken and sandwiches, chili is tasty, and salads are nice to start out with after the bread and onion of course! But why do you guys put so much salt in everything? I don't get restaurants on that, preserving the sauces for their trip over? I've noticed this with all mainstream chains, fast food, sodium everywhere. It's not good for nutrition at all and often leaves out better flavors for the familiar salty vibes. Would love to see a big national chain like Texas show up with better ways to flavor and preserve food that aren't making health magazine headlines (as refined salt) being a nasty rising issue along with good ole white sugar. Lots of space here, great location, very noisy and engaging atmosphere but I felt awkwardly perched on the end of our table with my own 5th wheel chair - not sure why we got that? Could hardly fit all our food on the table too, need to make sure bigger groups have space.",

      "text": "For the most part, I was let down. I've been coming to this location for years, and I have always had either very good service, or it was horrendous. Yes, I know it's my fault for continuing to go back to a place I will most likely be complaining about. But it's a convenient location. \n\nI'll start with the waitress. I don't remember her name, but her name tag said she had been there for 7 years. I don't know if it's because she had to work New Years Eve, or she was having a bad day or what, but I have never felt more like an inconvenience to anyone in my entire life. She smiled -literally- zero times. Her voice was low, annoyed, and monotone, even after myself and friends seemed to be over friendly to her. \n\nI ordered a Long Island. It came quickly... watered down and sad. Now, I know it's hard to taste liquor in a Long Island (or is that just me?), but I swear to you there didn't seem to be a drop. It tasted like watered down coke with a splash of toilet water. I quickly finished it so it would not water itself down anymore, and I could just get it off the table. I was so disappointed, but didn't say anything to our waitress because she was obviously having a bad day. \n\nI ordered the steak. It was good. Delicious actually. I wanted prime rib, but they were either out or weren't serving it that day, because when I asked if they had prime rib, she shortly replied \"No.\" \n\nMy boyfriend ordered the appetizer sampler, and What. A. Joke. The wings had obviously been microwaved. They were barely hot, chewy, and looked like plastic. The poppers, he said, were \"not bad\", and the potato skins were about as average looking and tasting as they come. \n\nI was so sad and will probably stick to the Texas Roadhouse in Avon from now on. The wait times are usually less, and the staff is *always* friendly.",

The knife that came with my napkin was a little dirty and she was apologetic about that. I ordered the combo that included an 8oz sirloin and half rack of ribs. I found the steak nicely seasoned (not too salty) and close enough to the medium I had ordered. It may have been a little closer to medium-rare, but it was good. Unfortunately, the ribs were pretty dry. The sauce helped. And the rolls! Yummy!  I kinda hoped I'd get a complimentary birthday dessert, but oh well. I was full. I wish they'd play something other than country music.",

On the few occasions when they haven't gotten the steak done the way I ordered it, they were gracious about redoing it, without the attitude that sometimes accompanies a slip up at other restaurants. Their beer selection is adequate, though could benefit from some improvement. We always appreciate the peanuts, and have never (that we remember) had a waiter or waitress who was anything but great. The decor is well-themed, with all sorts of little odds and ends to keep younger kids entertained on their way to the table.

I definitely couldn't make it better than they did even if I tried - and I have tried. I'm very picky about things like this, ham salad, potato salad etc. I don't like a lot of extra stuff in it - ham salad doesn't need grapes, celery, onion, walnuts etc. if it's good ham salad and that is what this is. Very simple but very delicious. The service was excellent as well and they have some really yummy looking homemade items in their refrigerated section that I will be trying as well.

Seriously one of the best burgers I've had in a long time and it was not even meat. Thanks to them for bringing it hard! The lemonade is also always delicious and the Mac bites are great too.

      "text": "SUPER local food truck and proud of it! I bookmarked their page a while back, and it's actually quite interesting. I'm not vegan or vegetarian in the least, but I've bought my lunch from them on more than one occasion. And it was good for that. Fortunately for me, I worked on campus, so when I got out of class, I'd make a short detour to where it was parked next to RAWL (one of their stops at the time), and pick up up something to eat. At that time, it tended to be the the grilled cheese and tater tots.\n\nActually, it's hard for me to write anything about their food because they're so good about changing up their menu and having new things. They're really big on creativity and using local ingredients. For example, they got a boatload of millet sometime back and start asking around what people thought they should make from it to sell. Said webpage will also tell you their schedule, menus, and whatnot. Overall, it's typically American comfort food, but I've seen items with the occasional Mexican or Italian or Greek influence. Great prices, fun, and carefully thought out dishes.\n\nPrepare yourself to wait for a bit after ordering. Staff are super friendly and open about any questions you have about the food. In general, they tend to be very responsive about feedback and ideas you may have. Mostly though, VIEW THEIR WEBSITE (as provided above). They provide the menu for each event on Facebook, announce special events and where they're going to be on Twitter, and their website (emtfoodtruck.com) has a calendar summarizing where they'll be and what kind of weather that day will be having. Speaking as someone who had dropped by one day without realizing that it was going to rain? This is very convenient. \n\nLike a number of noteworthy local restaurants, there are a number of local food trucks that you'll find at pretty much every big local event (festivals and such). This is one of them. If they're in your area, I'd highly recommend you to try it at least once.",

The food truck is completely vegetarian with several vegan options as well. That being said however, I think even the most avid meat eater will find anything from this truck delicious and satisfying. Their fry dipping sauce is amazing, and I'll even dip my burger in it. This is definitely the best place (and one of the ONLY places) in town to get a veggie burger. The savory waffles they use as bread/buns may seem a little strange at first but once you eat them you'll never want a sandwich on regular bread again. This is comfort food at its best, I just can't say enough nice things about this food truck! I wish they weren't closed during the winter :( but it gives me one more thing to look forward to in the spring.",

The sandwiches have waffles as bread, which sounds weird, but is really good.  They also had the option of regular or sweet potato fries (the sweet potato fries were awesome).  The truck moves around town and is open for lunch and sometimes dinner - you have to go to their website to see where they will be.\n\nMy only complaint is that they don't come to campus during the week.  Since that's where I work, it's hard to get downtown or somewhere else during lunch time, and I am sure that is true for many Purdue employees.",

These guys were really helpful and were more than happy to cater to our preferences of contactless payment and dropped the food off in our car trunk. Service is quick. \n\nFood was a little disappointing. The paneer sandwich/wrap in tzatziki sauce was lacklustre. The paneer in itself was pretty bland. It just seemed like they had thrown in some paneer cubes and dripped some sauce over it. Definitely needs more work. The Egyptian spicy fries were very good. The vegetarian samosas were also tasty.

Us quattro of guys was hankering for gyros and got treated well from the moment we stepped in, wish I got the skinny guy's name, very polite chap and took our orders tho spread across 10 minutes as two showed up later and weren't sure what they wanted. The menu is a great size and gives many reasons to come back! The only issues are frustrating parking with only 1 hour slots typically impossible to find during the semester; a more serious problem for sensitive types, the Arabian inspired atmosphere is lightly smothered in hookah smells and holds to clothing. Thankfully we were taking food to go and noticed the hookah aura less as we were this proper food takes about 20 minutes. Good to know a quick dip in for \"fast food\" isn't realistic here. We broke open the gyros and burrito to discover them Mediterranean spices turned up to 11! My friend's raved about the fries and nothing edible in the wraps was left after a few minutes for one aggressive eater. For $7, this place is a no duh option for value, quality, and flavors!",

      "text": "TL;DR food is very poorly made and the meat is extremely dry. The service is worse.\n\nBefore I get to the food, I have been at Purdue for over 3 years and this place consistently disappoints. I ordered from this place via GrubHub. Now there were issues with GrubHub having a shortage of drivers, so my order got canceled after the food was already made. \n\nI called GrubHub and they informed me that they paid the restaurant (because they had already made the food) and refunded me for my order. I asked if I could walk to the restaurant and pick up the food because it was already paid for, and GrubHub told me that it was alright for me to go pick up the food. \n\nWhen I got to the restaurant, they told me that they could not give me the food for free because they weren't paid. I proceeded to get GrubHub on the phone in front of them and had them talk to GrubHub directly where they were told that they had indeed been paid for the food. After that (20+ minute) conversation, the staff told me that I couldn't get the food for free since GrubHub had refunded me, which made no sense since they had already been paid for the food. After another half hour back and forth (usually I would've let it go by this point, but I was extremely frustrated), they changed their story and told me that they legally cannot give me food that had been sitting out for over 40 minutes (the duration of our back and forth) and then tried to get me to pay for a new order. \n\nSo service wise, this place would get a 0/5 if possible.\n\nFood wise, it's okay. Nothing special, and rather bland. But you really shouldn't expect much from such a place.\n\nOverall, I have yet to have anyone go there and actually recommend it. You're better off going to Chipotle down the street.",

Big chunks of tomato and chopped onions, simple and decent. \n\nOverall, I would try out the brick and mortar restaurant  to get a real feel for their food and try out their hookha.

Great setting. \n\nThere were a few people smoking the hookahs but I didn't notice too much since the wall was open and I was right next to it. This place is 21+ only.\n\nDrink menu was extensive and they had some great tropical cocktail options. They also have drink specials every day. I had a Tutti Fruity drink. Felt like I could have been relaxing on a beach somewhere. Very good drink.\n\nI ordered the lamb sandwich with salad instead of fries. Lamb was cooked correctly, but the sandwich was bland. At a Middle Eastern place, that is a mortal sin. Bland middle eastern food is another way of saying backyard, amateurishly-cooked american food. If the seasonings and the sauce aren't tasty, it's pointless. They did use the very thin style of pita which is not that common, but is better than the thick, bready ones for sandwiches.\n\nThe salad was chopped iceberg lettuce, diced red onions, diced tomatoes and a sprinkling of some type of white cheese. No dressing. Had to ask for some. Dressing was not impressive.\n\nThe real crime was that the menu said their homemade \"tzatziki\" sauce was on this lamb sandwich. Calling that tzatziki should be offensive to any Greek person in the world. It was sauce. I will give them that. But it had no cucumber flavor, didn't even taste like yogurt. So what the heck was that? It was bad, that's what it was.\n\nService was pretty good. Nice guy served us. But a flavorless lamb sandwich at a middle eastern place is unforgivable.",

      "text": "After having been to many hookah bars from California, and the Middle-East; this establishment left a lot to be desired. I could understand this being a prime spot for kids that have never smoked hookah, and are finally experiencing something new like this. But for anyone that has smoke previously, there were some issues that presented themselves up front. They use quick light coals which do not last long, and require a regular refresh. Even for quick lights, these seemed sub-par as you are unable to rotate the coals since they disintegrate. Yes, standard coal takes more effort to light, get to temperature, and maintain. But it smokes more evenly, and ultimately would require less product since 3-coals can last well over an hour. The flavors sound nice, however when we received ours, it was clear that they didn't add the flavor, which was validated by the server when we complained. We received a new flavor at no charge. The service was fine, but the food options we wanted were out, so we stuck to coffee and an iffy tiramisu. I would not come back, but I do think this would be a pretty awesome spot if I was a new college kid, and had never tried hookah before!",

We went in with a group of about 10 people relatively late on a night that was snowing pretty hard. We ordered drinks and several of the appetizers including falafel, hummus, samosas, and the spicy fries. I can't really complain about any of them, they were pretty much what I was expecting. My favorite was probably the spicy fries.\n\nThe hookah set up was okay. I won't lie, our group was full of people who are a bit of hookah snobs. I'm used to smoking out of my KM with a Lotus and Dream Hose at home. The hookah we smoked out of seemed kind of cheap and the hose was the thin washable plastic kind. They also use quick-light coals which I am not a huge fan of. With that being said, the flavor was good, the clouds were thick, and the bowl never got harsh despite how long our session was. The staff was super attentive about bringing us more coals and seemed friendly and knowledgeable.\n\nIf I am ever in the area, I will definitely come back!",

It was really good! Great smoking experience, and the coals were very consistently shifted. \n\nThe fries ended up being fantastic, with just the right amount of crunchiness. They weren't greasy, but I do think they could have been salted more, but then again, that's what a shaker is for. The margarita was well mixed and flavorful. I also ended up having a buttery nipple - the alcohol ended up overpowering the other tastes on that one, but I wasn't disappointed by it by any means. \n\nIf I'm in the area again, I would definitely come here again.

That was mostly because we knew the best Indian food was made in our houses, but also because there wasn't anything great to try.\n\nWhen I visited my cousin, an undergraduate at Purdue, last fall, I was surprised to see that she wanted to go to Dakshin. After all, there was so much on campus now, and I'd just brought her a truckload of Indian goodies from home! Not to mention that Purdue is supposed to have some of the best dining hall food in the country.\n\nBut away we went, to grab her gobi manchurian, and after a few bites I saw why - it's undeniably spicy, evoking the level of spice you get with dishes in India. The place is also canteen-like in nature: customer service is a non-parameter, and the food speaks for itself.\n\nI took my parents a few months later during a visit and they stuck to their typical North Indian orders (despite Dakshin offering South Indian food): chole bhatura for dad, parotta-kurma for mom, and chili paneer for me. All three lived up, with my father even buying extras for later in the week! When an Indian dad willingly pays for extra Indian food to take to a household where cooking is a daily occurrence, you know you have a win on your hands.",

      "text": "Love love love Greyhouse!! Stopped by this morning for a lil coffee/brunch date while visiting some Purdue friends (such a nice location from campus, by the way). \nThe aesthetic of the coffeehouse was perfect. Classy, cozy, cool - perfect for getting some work done or just hanging out. I also loved all the merch and coffee/tea accessories they sell by the counter!!\nIt was busy this morning, but not terrible. We got our drinks relatively fast and enjoyed them as we waited for our crepés. Those took a little bit of a wait, but that was expected. \nI ordered the Cardamom Mint Tea latte from their seasonal menu, and while the flavor was delicious, I definitely wish I had ordered something more hearty. It was a very light latte, and not exactly what I was looking for. I also ordered the Sundrenched Veggie crepé + added an egg and WOW - it was so so yummy. A perfect savory brunch. I do have to say that the egg was a little bit nonexistent, but I didn't mind too much because the crepé was so good anyways. \nOverall, I LOVE the concept of the crepery. Such a simple delight that pairs so well with their extensive coffee and tea menu. I can't wait to come back to try their gelato (I was eyeing the Blue Moon gelato!).",

      "text": "Greyhouse is elite W. LaLa. That's the best way I can describe it: it's the place you study at and feel like you'r a student at an Ivy League. It's the dessert and coffee spot you meet a professor at. It's where you take your parents to say 'look guys, I'm an adult! Now, buy me my fancy latte please.' It's the anti-college, and beautifully so.\n\nI'll be the first to admit I've actually never had the food there: I'd heard meh things and there was always too much else to try. Crepes overwhelm me, but I've heard the ones here are worth trying.\n\nMy companion and I rounded out our evening with Greyhouse gelato and as a tiramisu aficionado I must say: this did NOT disappoint. It played a symphony, of sorts, and when I revisited for coffee a few weeks later, I realized why Greyhouse is a Purdue favorite.\n\nIt is nurturing, comforting, and inspiring, all in the same cup (pardon the pun). Is it expensive? Most definitely. But it teaches you to grow up and embrace the finer things in life, even if for only a moment.",

I would say both times have been quite the disappointment. The berry crepe hardly had any berries, there was maybe half a strawberry and one blueberry, it was just filled with jam. The Hen crepe was full of cheese and potatoes; I kept digging until the very center to find any sign of eggs but no luck!! Considering the prices of their crepes it is unacceptable. I got the regular size medium roast coffee which was average. The ambience was above average for a coffee shop, hence the two stars.",

Which is the highest price of all the coffee places in the area, coffee shop and chain--actually the highest I've ever seen and I've been a barista. It's a shame I can't go here as often because of how busy the location is and how expensive it is. I recognize this place is high quality, but it becomes difficult to support a business when it is so pricey. If you're planning on going here for a date...start saving.",

      "text": "Two issues I've discovered: $1+ for non-dairy milk - please stop. The menu is already overpriced and hounding dairy sensitives with extra cost on top of the San Fran bistro prices is a nasty trick. My sister and I randomly went for a small cheesecakes, crepe, and drink. $22! That is bonkers! Did I buy a small steak? I graduated out of the Purdue system a decade ago but when did college kids collect copious cash in their cashmere coats just to consider conducting coffee commerce?! Speaking of prices, you'd think there's decent reasons. Again, nope and please stop. The large size only gets more milk, not more syrup or coffee! (my sister discovered this and seems to be true from my recent samplings) This is quite the caffeinated mafia setup. Thankfully the beverages have the effects. Dreamy even, syrups are made in house and offer fantastic tantalizing flavors. Greyhouse has many right elements, cool and friendly staff, attempts at a mobile app and rewards program, quality beverages, Marsala chai, Dr. Strangelove latte, and frozen hot cocoa are the essential temptations. Crepes (tasty), gelato (more so), evil deserts, plenty of teas, and an occasional avo toast pop ups on the menu. It all adds up to a too frequently lack of space amidst their alternative urban atmosphere. The recent remodel improved traffic flow but some of the food items don't feel as right as they used to be. Not to mention I'm still on those two issues. I've had friends tell me they love Greyhouse but often don't buy anything because it is so overpriced! Hello, earth to Greyhouse! Take a hint. Make it easier to add rewards when I don't purchase in the app like a normal coffee shop linking rewards to my card (Toast, Square). Show some love and ensure fair discounts are pushed through the mobile app, not just eventually showing up after I've taken out a small loan. But until then, we all can hit up Fuel near the engineering mall, Vienna next door, and Copper Moon over yonder. I love Sacred Grounds the most of all the area coffee drips tho they sadly close at 4 without weekend hours. Greyhouse needs to fair up prices and/or ensure loyal buyers (hopeful one here) are given due love and perks; maybe go the extra step for us all and ensure my $7.50 cup has a place to sit among those taking space without buying anything.",
